Africana Studies;AFRI 0090;An Introduction to Africana Studies;"This course introduces students to the vibrant and contested field of Africana Studies by critically exploring and analyzing the links and disjunctures in the cultural, political, and intellectual practices and experiences of people of African descent throughout the African diaspora. Beginning with a critical overview of the history, theoretical orientations, and multiple methodological strategies of the discipline, the course is divided into three thematic units that examine intellectuals, politics, and movements; identity construction and formation; and literary, cultural, and aesthetic theories and practices in the African diaspora.";“An Introduction to Africana Studies” (AFRI0090), taught by Professor Francoise Hamlin, is an introductory lecture course that serves to introduce students to the study of the African diaspora. The scope of the course is broad, encompassing history, literature and culture, identity formation, and methodologies within the field. Many students also felt that the class helped them to develop their skills as writers. As it is introductory, the course has no prerequisites, and class members felt that none were needed for them to get the most out of the semester. Some mentioned that a basic knowledge of American history was helpful but, again, not necessary.;90;13;1;1;0;1;0;1;0;1pm;Afternoon
Africana Studies;AFRI 0130;This is America: Reimagining the American Saga;History offers us a framework to appraise the forces and conditions that have formed people’s shared experiences. Because of this, the histories we tell are often explanatory. They delineate how we arrived at this moment and tell us which people and what events were most consequential. But what happens when the people who look like you are not part of the story? Or if their inclusion amounts to cameos in support of a larger narrative that ultimately minimizes or ignores their contributions? This course reimagines American history by placing in the foreground the people and events often marginalized or forgotten in traditional appraisals of the past. Through a review of historical sources, literature, oral histories, and evidence found in popular culture, this class offers a more inclusive retelling of the American saga.;N/A;130;13;2;1;1;0;0;0;0;3pm;Afternoon
Africana Studies;AFRI 0670;Global Black Radicalism;The decade from the mid-Sixties until the mid-Seventies witnessed the rise of Black Radicalism as a global phenomenon. The emergence of Black Power in the US, Brazil and the Caribbean, the consolidation of liberation struggles in Portuguese Africa and the rise of a Black Consciousness trend in Apartheid South Africa all represent key moments. What led young activists to embrace “Black Power?” What led to the emergence of Marxist movements in Portuguese Africa? What events in the Caribbean gave ascendancy to radical tendencies? And what forces contributed to the decline of these movements? This course seeks to answer these questions.;"Reviewers praised Professor Hamlin highly, saying that she encouraged critical thought and participation. Respondents noted that she created a learning environment in which they felt comfortable engaging in stimulating discussion. Professor Hamlin primarily lectured from PowerPoint slides and held question and answer sections at the end of each class period; she also frequently invited guest lecturers from different fields within Africana studies. Though reviews were extremely complimentary of the professor and the course in general, some students suggested that Professor Hamlin make her lectures more dynamic and provide more time for discussion. Class members nonetheless found her to be very approachable and available outside of class through email and during office hours, and they noted that she gave excellent feedback.";670;13;3;1;0;1;0;1;0;4pm;Afternoon
Africana Studies;AFRI 0800;Theorizing Racism;Why does racism persist in the twenty-first century? How has racism changed over time? Are the vast majority of Americans racist? Or does racism largely exist without racists? Is racism a problem we can overcome? Or is it a permanent feature of American democracy? This lecture course will examine these questions through a critical reconstruction of the most prominent theories of racism in the social sciences and humanities, identifying the concept’s central problem space, while simultaneously opening up the question, what, if anything, can be done to intervene on this stubbornly persistent problem. Along the way, we will also interrogate related concepts like racial injustice, racial prejudice, race relations, racial inequality, white supremacy, antiblack racism, and herrenvolk democracy.;N/A;800;13;4;1;0;1;0;1;0;2:30pm;Afternoon

Africana Studies;AFRI 1215;The Visual Culture of 1930s: Race, Gender, and the Laboring Body;The 1930s mark a moment of extraordinary change in the United States. The Great Depression precipitated a rethinking and reordering of the federal government’s response to economic, political, and social institutions. As part of this rethinking, the federal government sponsored an unprecedented number of art projects, creating jobs for thousands of painters, sculptors, photographers, printmakers, architects, filmmakers, writers, and actors. However, the New Deal art projects of President Franklin D. Roosevelt were not the only response to the changing times. The 1930s also saw the rise of leftist political artists and the strikingly conservative art forms of the so-called “Regionalist” painters. In this seminar, we will consider the federal art projects of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, social realism (broadly conceived), and the world’s fairs of the period—sometimes called the “Century-of-Progress” expositions.;;1215;13;7;2;0;1;0;1;0;4pm;Afternoon

Africana Studies;AFRI 1510;Making and Remaking Blackness in the Western World;This course is an interdisciplinary survey of cultural, social, and political expressions of Blackness among people of African descent in the Western World, primarily the United States, and the social forces that create various understandings of this identity. Black experiences of and reflections on what it means to be Black are articulated in writing, visual and performing arts, music, and social media. Students will read, listen, and view a wide of set of materials that reflect people of African descent and their negotiation, rejection, and reimagination of different forms of Blackness in affirmative and complex ways from the 18th century to the present. Primary and secondary texts will comprise the course readings and range from cultural studies, philosophy, critical race theory, sociology, political science, literature, and history, among other areas.;;1510;13;9;2;0;1;0;1;0;9am;Morning
Africana Studies;AFRI 2105;Professionalization Seminar;This course explores the mechanics of a doctorate degree in Africana Studies. We will explore the constitution of our field through the elaboration of exam lists and narratives, query its pedagogical application in the design of undergraduate syllabi, and begin to outline and enact our participation in the profession both within and beyond the academy. At the end of this class, students will have constructed a portfolio that will assist their progress towards a degree and provide the tools with which to chart pathways once a degree is in hand. A key component of the professionalization courses is the construction of an undergraduate syllabus by each student, which will subsequently be revised and discussed during the dissertation proposal defense, and which will be taught in either the first semester of the student’s fourth or fifth year.;;2105;13;10;3;1;0;0;0;0;3pm;Afternoon
Africana Studies;AFRI 2303;Black Feminism and the Politics of Care and Pleasure;"This graduate course, primarily U.S.-focused, examines Black feminist thought globally and focuses on the theoretical contributions of Black and African Diasporan feminists who contribute Black feminist thought through the lens of care and pleasure in and out of a variety of disciplinary fields from the late-19th and early 20th century onward. These contributions highlight the history and development of Black feminist thought as a methodology in the humanities and social sciences and include but is not limited to work expressed as “multiracial feminism,” “critical race feminism,” “transnational Black feminism,” “womanism,” and “pleasure politics.” The course will address these theories and the concerns of Black feminists (intersectionality, reproductive health; sexual violence; homophobia, transphobia, and heteronormativity; the subordination of Black women; and the effects of racism and colonialism on Black communities) through the critical examination of a wide range of texts.";;2303;13;11;3;0;0;1;0;0;3pm;Afternoon

American Studies;AMST 1200D;Popular Ideas: United States Political Culture from Above and Below;This course will explore public debates shaped by interactions between the everyday worlds of popular culture and the formal spheres of intellectual debate and ideas. Organized around case studies from several periods of U.S. history, the course will examine how key themes in American culture and politics—democracy and capitalism, equality and exclusion, freedom and domination, war and peace, modernity and tradition, empire and internationalism—have been shaped by ideas originating from popular entertainments and movements, the treatises of philosophers, essayists, or reformers, and producers and audiences that blur the lines between the two. Overall, students should gain a working understanding of the evolution of both popular culture and intellectual thought and how they combined to reveal and shape the development of American democracy and the conflicts that have driven U.S. history. Sessions will combine short lectures, discussions, and primary source workshops.;;1200;15;2;1;0;1;0;1;0;2:30pm;Afternoon

We examine the institutional and social contexts of cultural production and consumption in the United States. We will cover a variety of cultural forms (e.g. music, film, tv, and social media) and explore culture as an arena of conflict and a vehicle for social change. Other areas of focus include the meaning of aesthetics and style in daily life, cultural gatekeeping, and the role of social media platforms in shaping the production, distribution, and consumption of cultural texts/commodities.;;1611;15;5;1;1;0;1;0;1;11am;Morning
American Studies;AMST 1700X;Global Macho: Race, Gender, and Action Movies;Carefully sifting through an oft-overlooked but globally popular genre - the muscle-bound action film - this class asks: what sort of racial work does an action movie do? What is the role of women in this genre? How should we scrutinize these supposedly empty trifles of the global popular? How should we think critically about movies that feature - often without apology - a deep, dangerous obsession with masculinity, patriarchy, war, and lawlessness, with violence outside of civil society. In short, from Hollywood to Hong Kong to Rio to Paris to Mexico City, what makes the action movie genre tick?;;1700;15;6;2;1;0;1;0;1;10am;Morning

American Studies;AMST 1906V;Virtual Bodies: Play, Power, Performance;This seminar investigates digital media practices at the intersection of virtual and embodied experience, from video games and virtual communities to viral dance videos and motion-sensing surveillance systems. How do digitally mediated play, performance, and participatory culture incorporate and/or undermine technologies of power and control? How have new interfaces and media platforms invoked and reshaped ideas about liveness, creativity, authenticity, community, and privacy? What happens when embodied techniques and repertoires are taught and learned using digital media? Readings draw on media ethnography, performance studies, interface studies, and theories of intersectional embodied identity. Class members will undertake a series of practice exercises in which they learn new skills from online sources and collectively reflect on this process. Registration permission granted based on questionnaire distributed at first class meeting.;;1906;15;8;2;0;0;0;0;1;3pm;Afternoon
American Studies;AMST 1906X;Black Queer Life;This course explores how Black writers and artists represent and theorize a diverse array of Black genders and sexualities. We will begin with a series of conversations on the origins of Black queer theory, and then use these conversations to anchor us in our readings of Black queer life in literary and popular culture. Reading across a range of genres, including film, music, poetry, comics, and short fiction, we will collectively consider the ways sex, gender, and sexuality work with other markers of difference and social status such as race, class, ability, and nationality to demarcate possibilities, freedoms, choices, and opportunities available to Black people. We will learn from theorists, writers, and artists including Audre Lorde, Cathy Cohen, E. Patrick Johnson, Nicole Dennis Benn, Alexis Pauline Gumbs, Danez Smith, Janelle Monae, Samuel Delany, among many others.;;1906;15;9;2;0;1;0;1;0;1pm;Afternoon

Anthropology;ANTH 0100;Introduction to Cultural Anthropology;This course provides an introduction to cultural anthropology, surveying its defining questions, methods, and findings. We will examine the history and utility of anthropology's hallmark method, ethnography, the long-term immersion of the researcher in the culture under study. We will compare cultural anthropology's findings and comportment in other cultures to its conclusions and conduct in our own. No prerequisites.;"""Introduction to Cultural Anthropology"" (ANTH0100) is a course taught by Professor Andrea Flores that aims to present students with the various methods of anthropology as well as a survey of its theories and history. There are no official prerequisites, and many respondents noted that it was their very first class in the department or even their first humanities course at Brown.

Professor Flores received positive reviews from students. The format of the course, which consisted of PowerPoint lectures, was deemed an effective way to present the material. Students were also required to attend a weekly discussion section, which was found to be helpful in understanding the assigned readings. Although some noted that the content of the lectures themselves could be dull, class participants thought that the instructor's style was clear, informative, and engaging. Additionally, respondents found her to be extremely approachable and available outside of class, with multiple students commenting that she was quite helpful in her office hours. She also emphasized using hands-on activities to help teach the class. Additionally, the TA for the course received very favorable reviews and was described as a valuable resource when completing the written work.

Assignments required for ANTH0100 included three short response papers, two three-page anthropological method papers (the lowest grade of which was dropped), and two final papers that were five pages each. Students were also required to complete readings for each week, which some students found could be rather dense and lengthy at times. However, although the class sometimes had to read an entire book in a single week, respondents thought the readings were generally interesting and necessary for understanding the course material. Furthermore, some students felt that the written assignments were rather difficult to approach and were graded more harshly than anticipated; others noted that one had to synthesize the readings in an academic way for the response papers.

Overall, course participants were satisfied with their experience in Professor Flores's course, which served as an accessible introduction to the study of cultural anthropology. While some expressed a desire for a more diverse lecture format and less extensive reading requirements, all recommended the class to future students. Additionally, they also recommended that shoppers look into other similar courses that provide a comparable exposure to anthropology as an academic discipline.";100;21;1;1;1;0;1;0;0;11am;Morning
Anthropology;ANTH 0800;Sound and Symbols: Introduction to Linguistic Anthropology;This introduction to the study of language and culture considers how language not only reflects social reality but also creates it. We'll examine specific cases of broad current relevance, in the process learning how an analytical anthropological approach to language use lays bare its often hidden power. We'll consider how language creates and reinforces social inequality and difference, how language promotes and resists globalization, and how language is used creatively in performance, literature, film, advertising, and mass media. We will also consider how language does important social work in specific contexts, such as classrooms, courtrooms, medical settings, and political campaigns.;;800;21;2;1;3;3;3;3;3;3;3

Anthropology;ANTH 1622;Archaeology of Settler Colonialism;The course uses settler colonialism as a framework for understanding how European colonists attempted to displace and eliminate Indigenous peoples beginning in the 15th century and its historical implications for structural inequalities of race and gender. We will look at how settler colonialism is different from colonialism, and more importantly, at resistances challenging its ambitions. Case studies from North America mostly, but also Australia, South Africa, and other settler colonial societies will focus on historical archaeology’s contributions to illuminating settler colonialist strategies for establishing and maintaining settler sovereignty in light of concerns for decolonizing archaeological practices. We will give special attention to the insights gained about the experiences of dispossessed, enslaved, and marginalized peoples and their descendants, and the many ways their actions critiqued settler colonialism and imagined different futures.;;1622;21;7;1;0;1;0;1;0;10:30am;Morning

The goal is to illustrate the typical way in which applied mathematicians approach practical applications, from understanding the underlying problem, creating a model, analyzing the model using mathematical techniques, and interpreting the findings in terms of the original problem. Single-variable calculus is the only requirement; all other techniques from differential equations, linear algebra, and numerical methods, to probability and statistics will be introduced in class. Prerequisites: Math 0100 or equivalent.";"“Introduction to Modelling” (APMA0200) is a lecture-based introductory math course designed to teach students the basics of mathematical modeling using selected examples from biology, chemistry, engineering, and physics. The course description describes the goal as learning ""the typical way applied mathematicians approach practical application, from understanding the underlying problem, creating a model, analyzing the model using mathematical techniques, and interpreting findings in terms of the original problem.” Single-variable calculus (MATH0100) or equivalent AP Calculus BC credit is the only pre-requisite. Students also noted that ""Multivariable Calculus"" (MATH0180) and ""Methods of Applied Mathematics I, II"" (APMA0330) were helpful as well.

Professor Constantine Dafermos was generally regarded as a very effective and clear lecturer who typically used the chalkboard to work out proofs and problems. Some reviewers wrote that lectures could “go over their heads” at times, but acknowledged Professor Dafermos’s openness to questions and repetition of key concepts. Although Professor Dafermos had no set office hours, he was usually available upon request. Multiple students suggested more grading feedback as a way to improve the course.

The course featured almost-weekly homework assignments, a final project that was similar to the homework, and no exams. Students were mixed in their assessment of the difficulty of the assignments, but most agreed that they were relevant to lecture and the course goals. The most common suggestions for improvement were to have some kind of literature available, such as accompanying readings or posted lecture notes, and to have a clearer grading structure.

In summary, most students liked this class for its practical “applications of math to common life,” as well as for Professor Dafermos's clarity and teaching style. Reviewers suggested shoppers look at MATH0180 or MATH0200 as well as mathematical modelling courses in biology and other departments.

Applied Mathematics;APMA 0350;Applied Ordinary Differential Equations;"This course provides a comprehensive introduction to ordinary differential equations and their applications. During the course, we will see how applied mathematicians use ordinary differential equations to solve practical applications, from understanding the underlying problem, creating a differential-equations model, solving the model using analytical, numerical, or qualitative methods, and interpreting the findings in terms of the original problem. We will also learn about the underlying rigorous theoretical foundations of differential equations. Prerequisites: MATH 0100 or equivalent; knowledge of matrix-vector operations, determinants, and linear systems.";"“Applied Ordinary Differential Equations” (APMA0350) is an introductory course that dives into the practical applications and theoretical underpinnings of ordinary differential equations. Prerequisites include an intermediate calculus course (MATH0100, MATH0180, or equivalent). Reviewers emphasized that a linear algebra course (MATH0520 or MATH0540), which can be taken concurrently, was very helpful for this class. Other useful courses included basic physics (e.g. PHYS0070) and engineering (e.g. ENGN0040) to some extent.

Professor Bjorn Sandstede was praised for being an enthusiastic lecturer, presenting in a constantly systematic format, providing clear and ample post-lecture notes and recordings, encouraging questions, and soliciting feedback through optional weekly Canvas reflections. One student said, “My man Bjorn has the teaching skills of a god and speaks so eloquently.” Respondents were particularly appreciative of how Bjorn demonstrated care for his students by being responsive to their emails and enthusiastically conversing with them about content outside of the course. The lectures were described to mostly cover theory and proofs. Reviews were mixed regarding the pace of Professor Sandstede’s lectures.

Coursework consisted of weekly problem sets, one in-class midterm, two take-home capstone problem sets, and a final group project (10 to 15-page paper). Many reported that the coursework was manageable and the content easy to follow (with an average of five hours a week dedicated outside of class), as long as attention and attendance were maintained. As the class requires no textbook, readings and other assigned materials were generally deemed worthwhile. TA and office hours also helped students sift through conceptually-dense lecture material and recognize their relevance to assignments and applicability to the real world. Multiple reviewers commented that the homework and exams focused on problem-solving and mathematical applications rather than lengthy proofs, making the course interesting for non-math concentrators. Feedback on assignments was prompt and fair.

Respondents generally agreed that the course material was engaging and manageable, made so by Bjorn’s effective and efficient teaching and supportive TA staff.

Several students stated that familiarity with linear algebra was helpful but not necessary.

Professor Maxey was described by students as responsive to his students’ needs and as genuinely caring about their learning. For instance, feedback/check-in forms were put out to gauge how students were doing every month or so. Respondents pointed out that the lectures were in the standard format of slides and handwritten notes, which some found to be “dry at times.” Students found that Professor Maxey was very clear on “deviating each step,” but some said that the lectures could be confusing and difficult to piece together. That being said, many appreciated Professor Maxey’s preparation prior to each lecture.

The assessments for APMA0360 included three reflections, weekly homework, two Capstone assignments, one midterm, and one final project. Several respondents mentioned wanting the class to be more engaging between the instructor and the students, and some suggested including a preview of content that would be covered in the class earlier in the semester.

Overall, students found APMA0360 and Professor Maxey to be effective at introducing partial differential equations. One respondent pointed out that the “content is very specific but satisfying once [understood].” However, the same respondent did not recommend this course for non-concentrators.";360;26;3;1;1;0;1;0;1;12pm;Afternoon

ASYR;ASYR 0998;Wrong For Good Reasons: An Introduction to the History of Science;Lavoisier! Galileo! Newton! According to widespread narratives: heroes of science and progress. These heroes, we are told, triumphed over the obdurate fools who held back the march of science out of deliberate ignorance. But things are not so simple, for their objectors often had good reasons to be “wrong”. Through the study of landmark examples selected from Antiquity to the Early Modern Era in what we would call today the fields of Chemistry, Cosmology, Astronomy, and Optics, students will reevaluate received narratives of “science” and “progress”. Students will read (in English translation) primary sources ranging from ancient Babylonian astronomical texts to excerpts of Huygens’ treatise on light. There are no prerequisites.;;998;5;1;1;3;3;3;3;3;3;3

The course covers a wide breadth of topics, from the history of biotechnology to the approaches to inventing biotechnology to its ethical implications. There are no prerequisites for this class; students noted that although background knowledge of current events in biology or introductory knowledge of biological systems was useful, it was not absolutely necessary for their success in the course.

Professor Toni-Marie Achilli was praised by respondents as an amazing lecturer, with organised and clear slideshows as well as engaging presentations. She was an effective facilitator of discussions and encouraged students to always ask questions and critically analyze what they learned. She was additionally commended for her passion, experience, and generous accommodation of student needs. Professor Achille held frequent office hours and reviewers appreciated her always welcoming persona. Though some students noted her lectures to be a little fast-paced, her easily digestible and clear slideshows as well as lecture capture usage allowed students to stay on track.

Assignments included weekly readings and quizzes, two papers, and three in-class exams. Although exams were open note, students still noted them to be a time crunch. Weekly quizzes were submitted through canvas and readings covered a variety of topics, including organ replacement, tissue engineering, stem cells, and pharmaceutical development. The readings were noted to be “hit or miss” in regard to their effectiveness towards a student’s overall understanding of course material. The overall workload was noted to be relatively light.

Overall, students greatly enjoyed this course and its multidimensional study of biotechnology.

Biology;BIOL 0190P;Pride and Prejudice in the Development of Scientific Theories;"We will examine how the pace and shape of scientific progress is affected by the social/cultural context and the ""personality"" of the individual. We will look into how the interplay between society and the individual affects how scientific theories arise, are presented, are debated and are accepted. The course will initially focus on Charles Darwin and his theory of Natural Selection using the biography of Adrian Desmond and James Moore, ""Darwin: The Life of a Tormented Evolutionist."" Enrollment limited to 19 first year students.";"“Pride and Prejudice in the Development of Scientific Theories” (BIOL0190P) is a first-year seminar exploring the effects of social and cultural context on the advancement of scientific knowledge. A primary focus of the course is Charles Darwin and his theory of Natural Selection. There are no official prerequisites for the course, as students noted that the course was designed to be accessible to students of all academic backgrounds. However, class members agreed that a basic background and interest in biology was useful.

Students universally praised Professor Stephen Helfand for his depth of knowledge and enjoyed the laid back discussions that primarily filled classes. Students were especially appreciative of Professor Helfand’s passion, sense of humor, and “unique life advice.” Students welcomed Professor Helfand’s insights, which guided discussions through intriguing and enlightening points of topics. Several students noted that some class members rarely spoke and suggested that the instructor take on a more active role in leading discussions. Professor Helfand did not hold regular office hours, but students agreed that his availability through email and appointments was more than sufficient.

The course assignments consisted of weekly readings, one presentation, and one final paper. Students were also expected to lead two class discussions with a partner. Students characterized the pace of the course as low-pressure. One student stated an appreciation for the focus of promoting “learning rather than memorization”; most agreed that the assignments successfully facilitated a thorough understanding of the concepts addressed in the readings and in class discussions.

All in all, students overwhelmingly agreed that the course was highly worthwhile as an opportunity to explore a subject underlying the content of other scientific courses while experiencing Professor Helfand’s unique wit and insight.

Limited to 19 freshmen.";"""Phage Hunters, Part I"" (BIOL0190R) is the first semester of a research-based lab class for first-years, which seeks to isolate and characterize bacteriophage viruses found in the soil. Students will also learn about DNA isolation, purification, and restriction mapping through rigorous and immersive laboratory work. There are no prerequisites, though several respondents mentioned AP Biology and AP Chemistry as being helpful in understanding the material.

BIOL01904 was taught by Professor Sarah Taylor. Professor Taylor was praised by her students for being extremely passionate and knowledgeable about the material; one class member described her as a ""pure force of nature."" Respondents appreciated her understanding of student needs, her openness to suggestions, and her dedication to making sure that students were succeeding while also giving them the space to learn and practice the material for themselves. Students also enjoyed her lecture style and her well-prepared materials. However, some found that maintaining focus could be difficult during the two-and-a-half hour lecture period, especially since the lecture material was not always relevant for lab work, and suggested having shorter lectures twice a week.

Assignments for the course consisted of two short homework assignments, weekly lab every week, and a final presentation on each person's phage. Students noted that though there was little work outside of class and lab, Laboratory work was a significant time commitment; several remarked that they put in extra lab hours to make things work. A note to potential shoppers: this year, the final exam was replaced with a large homework assignment, but this is unlikely to be true in the future.

Overall, respondents greatly enjoyed this course for its extreme flexibility and the unique skills it taught. Potential class members are advised to stay on top of their lab notebooks, to take advantage of the small class size and meet new people, and to keep in mind that as they will be learning a new skill set. Frustration is a natural part of the process!

Biology;BIOL 0200;The Foundation of Living Systems;"A broad overview of biological systems, emphasizing patterns and processes that form the basis of life. Explores essentials of biochemistry, molecular, and cellular biology and their relationship to the larger issues of ecology, evolution, and development. Examines current research trends in biology and their influence on culture. Appropriate for all students interested in biology. Serves as a gateway course to much of the intermediate and advanced curriculum. Placement tests are offered (contact Jody_Hall@brown.edu); AP scores of 4 or 5 are equivalent to BIOL 0200, and place a student out of this course. Students will be assigned to a lab time during the second week of class.";"“The Foundation of Living Systems” (BIOL0200) is the foundational course for the biology concentration, though it is designed to be taken by students in any concentration as part of a liberal education. It explores a wide range of biology topics in depth, including molecular biology, genetics, evolution, ecology, and physiology. The only prerequisite is high-school-level biology and chemistry, and reviewers found only basic knowledge of biology necessary to succeed. Several reviewers also had taken AP Biology, although an exam score of 4 is sufficient to place out of the course.

Professors Ken Miller and John Stein co-taught BIOL0200, and students mostly found both of their lecture styles highly effective. In particular, Professor Miller was lauded for his clarity and passion around the subject, his use of anecdotes and connections to broader themes, and the way he cared deeply for his students. One respondent even mentioned that Professor Miller set aside time to eat at dining halls with his students. Some classmates wished he had focused his lectures more on the content included in homework and exams, as they felt the course’s breadth of material and fast pace was especially challenging. Professor Stein was praised for his focused lecture style that explained difficult topics precisely with thoughtful visualizations, although some found these lectures somewhat dry. On the whole, respondents were excited to attend lectures.

For this course, students were required to complete textbook and article readings, short post-lecture quizzes, weekly homework assignments, weekly 80-minute labs, three midterms, and a final exam. Opinions on the readings varied: one reviewer noted their inconsistent frequency while most respondents reported spending an hour or two per week on them. While the short quizzes had an unlimited number of attempts and labs were graded on participation, the homework and exams were generally considered challenging. Students found they spent most of their time studying between lectures and before exams in order to grasp the large volume of course content. This was balanced by what most considered a relatively lenient grading policy, with the lowest midterm score being dropped. Respondents agreed that hard work was sufficient to receive a good grade in this course.

The most common sentiment regarding BIOL0200 was feeling overwhelmed with the number of topics covered mixed with satisfaction with the course’s instruction. Some students felt the course would be suitable for anyone interested in biology, while others recommended skipping to higher-level biology courses, such as “Principles of Physiology” (BIOL0800). Alternatively, shoppers might consider “The Brain: An Introduction to Neuroscience” (NEUR0010) for an introductory biology course";200;51;5;1;1;0;1;0;1;9am;Morning

It will draw on examples and case studies from the geological record, functional morphology, the evolution of organ systems in vertebrates, genomics, behavior and sexual selection in birds and invertebrates. Overarching themes will emphasize that taxonomic diversity is an emergent property of complex life on Earth, and the importance of diversity of biological functions and processes in generating and maintaining taxonomic diversity. The course is open to all students.;;210;51;6;1;3;3;3;3;3;3;3
Biology;BIOL 0380;The Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Disease;Infectious diseases remain among the leading causes of death worldwide, and this burden is disproportionately borne by children living in low- and middle-income countries. Thus management of infectious disease remains a critical intellectual challenge in the 21st century. This course will develop and apply ecological and evolutionary theory to infectious microbes (and their hosts) via the detailed examination of a number of case studies. This will be accomplished by a combination of lectures, discussions, and readings drawn mainly from the primary literature. Assessment will be based on biweekly problem sets, two midterms and one final exam. Expected: BIOL 0200, BIOL 0210 or equivalent.;"“The Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Disease” (BIOL0380) is a course taught by Professor Kelsey Witt Dillon that covers the fundamentals of ecological and evolutionary theory in relation to infectious diseases. In addition, the course exposes students to primary scientific literature. The prerequisite for this class is ""Foundations of Living Systems"" (BIOL0200) or equivalent. Students remarked that some background in biology was important.

Professor Witt Dillon was praised for her teaching over the course of the semester. She used slides to accompany her lectures which students felt were very helpful. Studies were incorporated into lecture content. Those who took the class found them interesting at times and sometimes less pedagogically stimulating. Overall, Dr. Witt Dillon was praised for her passion for the subject and effective teaching style.

The assignments for the course consisted of one or two readings per lecture, one problem set completed in a group for each of the six units. There were short quizzes online for each lecture and students had a week to complete them. The exams were all take-home with one midterm and one final. There was also a lengthy research paper final group project.

Overall, respondents felt that the class was set up to be very conducive to their success. One student remarked that the way that the class “links ecology with molecular biology” was incredibly interesting. Some reviewers noted that the focus on COVID-19 and vaccines was redundant after living through the pandemic so they enjoyed other parts of the course more. Prospective students who are looking for an introduction to evolutionary dynamics of infectious disease should take this class.";380;51;7;1;1;0;1;0;1;10am;Morning

If you plan to take BIOL 470 but are also considering registering for a course that conflicts with the BIOL 470 lecture period, you may be eligible to do so by enrolling in S02, an alternative section of BIOL 470. Enrollment in this section allows students asynchronous engagement with lectures which are recorded and posted to the course Canvas page at the end of each class period. In-person participation in laboratory meetings and exams, however, are still required.;"“Genetics” (BIOL0470) is a course that focuses on genetics at “molecular, cellular, organismal, and population levels.” BIOL0200 or the equivalent placement are prerequisites for this course. Many students noted that either BIOL0800 or BIOL0500 were helpful courses to have taken before this course.

This course was taught by three different professors: Professor Robert Reenan, Professor Mark Johnson, and Professor Erica Larschan. Each professor taught a different section of the course (beginning, middle, and end). Opinions on the three lecturers were very mixed. Overall, Professor Reenan is kind to students and goes through the content very quickly. He uses presentations that are full of content. Professor Johnson goes in depth in his teaching. He is very responsive to student questions and open to discussing content after class. Professor Larschan is very passionate about the content, and this makes her lectures much more engaging. Each professor had unique teaching styles that were helpful to different students.

In addition to weekly lectures, this course consisted of weekly discussion sections and a weekly lab section. There were nine homework assignments, four take-home exams, optional weekly readings, and occasionally lab assignments. Students noted that while the optional readings could be helpful, they were not required for success in BIOL0470. On average, a typical week seems to be between four and six hours, however, some weeks students reported spending over ten hours working.

Many respondents noted that this course is worthwhile in content and can be successfully completed when the effort is put in. This is a very “apply-heavy” course, and completing assigned homework is essential to facilitate understanding. Students also noted that office hours and clinics were important for high achievement in the course. This course is “difficult but worthwhile.”";470;51;9;1;1;0;1;0;1;9am;Morning

chinese;CHIN 0100;Basic Chinese;A year-long introduction to Standard Chinese (Mandarin). Speaking, reading, writing, and grammar. Five classroom meetings weekly. This is the first half of a year-long course whose first semester grade is normally a temporary one. Neither semester may be elected independently without special written permission. The final grade submitted at the end of course work in CHIN 0200 covers the entire year and is recorded as the final grade for both semesters.;"Basic Chinese” (CHIN0100) is the first course of a year-long sequence that introduces students to Mandarin Chinese, teaching skills in speaking, reading, and writing, as well as covering the grammar of the language. There are no official prerequisites for this course, though many students had prior exposure to Chinese through classes in high school.

There were four professors who taught the class in a seminar style, all of whom asked many questions in class and called on students to respond. This format allowed instructors to give immediate and constructive feedback about the students' Chinese pronunciations, which many respondents appreciated. The instructors were described as patient and encouraging, as well as readily available to meet with students outside of class.

Assignments for CHIN0100 consisted of daily listening and reading homework, two quizzes per week, oral skits, occasional speech recordings, four exams, and a final that had both written and oral components. Students commented on the time commitment required for such a constant flow of assignments, but generally felt that all the work was necessary for learning the language, despite the difficulty at times.

Overall, students highly recommended this class for shoppers interested in learning Chinese. Highlights of the class included the oral skits and the two-on-one sessions, which were weekly fifteen minute sessions with an instructor to practice pronunciation, vocabulary, and sentence structure. In general, students suggested that the course could be improved by slowing down the pace and including more opportunities to practice with less structured conversation. Students recommended other classes in Chinese history to interested students. However, they also stated that ""Basic Chinese"" is worth the effort, especially because the professors truly make this course enjoyable and fulfilling.";100;6;1;1;0;1;0;1;0;2:30pm;Afternoon

All four language skills are emphasized through selected authentic materials. At the end of the year, students should be able to express their ideas with sophistication and nuance. Drills on complex sentence patterns will be conducted when necessary. Prerequisite: CHIN 0600 or permission of instructor.;"Looking to perfect your knowledge of Chinese? Then take “Advanced Modern Chinese II” (CHIN0700)! This course aims to teach students complex sentence patterns and enhance their skills in all four domains of language: writing, reading, speaking, and listening. This course only has one prerequisite, CHIN0600, but this can also be waived with permission from the instructor.

Professor Yang Wang, whom students called Wang Laoshi, was universally lauded by students. She was praised for her positivity and flexibility, which allowed the course to be accessible to many students. Additionally, she was complimented for her efforts in engaging all the students in class and using relevant materials to teach Chinese. Wang Laoshi was described as passionate and one student said that there is nothing they would change about her.

Assignments for the course included two essays, daily homework assignments, and oral presentations. There were also multiple quizzes throughout the semester and three tests. Prospective students are advised to review lessons after class and to use audio files in conjunction with the textbook to ensure that they have the highest level of understanding.

Overall, students highly recommended others to take this course, even if they are not prospective concentrators. However, one student did mention that, since this is a higher level Chinese course, there are higher expectations, making this course a little more difficult than CHIN0500 and CHIN0600. Despite that, a few students mentioned that it is worthwhile to take the course solely because Wang Laoshi is one of the many great professors in the Chinese Department.";700;6;5;3;1;0;1;0;1;11am;Morning
chinese;CHIN 0912;Chinese Language and Culture;This course is designed for advanced learners of Chinese to enhance their language proficiency, as well as to grasp essential skills to observe and appreciate Chinese culture from the perspective of language, especially through Chinese radicals, idioms, proverbs, taboos, verses, vernacular language and internet language.

Classics;CLAS 0210T;Travelers in Greece: from Pausanias to Shirley Valentine;"Ever since Pausanias the Periegete wrote his ""Description of Greece"" in the 2nd century CE, travelers have been inspired both to see the sights of Greece and to narrate their travels. The subject of this course is travel narratives about Greece, and our own journey will lead us to sites throughout the country. Yet we will also be using these narratives as launchpads for exploring the imaginary and imagined power of the Greek landscape: from its ancient status as seat of the gods to its modern appeal as a land of anonymity, relaxation and freedom for the wearied 'westerner'.";N/A;210;12;1;1;0;1;0;1;0;9am;Morning

These modern metaphors continue a long history of equating female sexual allure with dangers found in/or capable of subverting Nature. This course will use contemporary methodologies to make sense of similar descriptions of women found in Greco-Roman literature: how do the Greeks and Romans express a concern about gender, ethnicity, class, and/or politics using these metaphors? How do these same categories help distinguish what is ""natural"" from ""unnatural""? To what end does this discourse about women and nature affect law, public space, or other aspects of ""civilization""?";N/A;765;12;2;1;0;1;0;1;0;9am;Morning
Classics;CLAS 0900;Greek Mythology;"What is a story? Does it have a life of its own? In this class, we will explore the ancient Greek stories (or “myths”) of creation, Pandora, the Golden Fleece, Hercules, the Trojan War, the Greek goddesses and gods, and many, many more. But we will also think about the telling of these myths. What do the tellers need from these stories? How do they change the stories to fit their contexts? And is it possible to separate the “myth” from any particular telling of it? No prerequisites required; all texts in translation.";"“Greek Mythology” (CLAS0900) is “an introduction to Ancient Greek mythological traditions.” The course covers the stories of creation — Pandora, the Golden Fleece, Hercules, the Trojan War, the Greek gods and goddesses, and a plethora of others — with a focus on “the telling of these myths.” The class has no prerequisites, and students affirmed there was no background necessary.

Professor Stephen Kidd was praised as a highly effective and passionate teacher, as one student described him as “the best lecturer I have had at Brown.” One reviewer also said Professor Kidd did an excellent job of distilling complicated readings into more digestible lectures. Other respondents appreciated how funny and engaging he was and the way that he consistently kept the course focused on what he defined as the central question “What is myth?”

Course grades were based on participation, weekly Canvas discussion posts to the readings, two exams, and two papers. Students emphasized the leniency of the grading on all assignments, with several stating that doing the assignments was enough to guarantee a Pass the course. Some found the readings dense but emphasized that Professor Kidd’s lecture skills make the process of comprehending and completing the readings much smoother.

Respondents overwhelmingly recommended this course for potential shoppers, with the most common adjective used to describe it being “fun.” Reviewers said it was worthwhile for concentrators and non-concentrators alike. If you are interested in Greek mythology (or are a fan of Percy Jackson), this might be the class for you!";900;12;3;1;1;0;1;0;1;1pm;Afternoon
Classics;CLAS 1120B;Epic Poetry from Homer to Lucan;Traces the rich history and manifold varieties of the genre of epic poetry in the literatures of ancient Greece and Rome beginning with Homer's Iliad and Odyssey (VII c.

Classics;CLAS 1225;History of Greece: From Alexander the Great to the Roman Conquest;In 334 BCE, the 22-year-old Alexander crossed over to Asia and North Africa, changing the history of the West forever. The invasion by a small, if intensely introspective, Greek peoples led to the spread of a monotheistic idea, belief in individualism, alienation from central power, and, conversely, the creation of natural law and human rights, and a deep desire for universalism. By its silences, the preserved narrative (constructed by European males) minimizes the lives of women, children, slaves, and those not of European origin. But largely because of Alexander’s conquests and the expansion of cosmopolitan thinking, the evidence embedded in Hellenistic history is far more diverse than for most other periods of classical history. This course focuses on inclusive social and intellectual history. Of particular emphasis will be the tension between the individual and the search for universal connection.;N/A;1225;12;7;2;0;1;0;1;0;1pm;Afternoon
Classics;CLAS 1331;Provincial Perspectives: Peopling the Roman Empire;For centuries the Roman empire spanned three continents and over 4 million square kilometers, encompassing a vibrant array of cultures that would combine to create what we often simply call ‘Roman’. At its height, the empire had a heterogeneous population on the order of 60 million people, the vast majority of whom lived not in the capital city of Rome but in what were known as the provinces. This course foregrounds the perspective of these diverse people and places. We will explore how Roman imperialism both shaped and was shaped by those living in the provinces, drawing on the extensive range of archaeological and textual evidence at our disposal in order to incorporate as many viewpoints as possible.;;1331;12;8;2;0;1;0;1;0;1pm;Afternoon

Cognitive and Psychology;CLPS 0010;Mind, Brain and Behavior: An Interdisciplinary Approach;This course will provide an interdisciplinary approach to the science of the mind through lens of psychology, cognitive science, cognitive neuroscience, behavioral neuroscience, computational modeling and linguistics, as uniquely represented by our department. It will focus on questions that drive the field, current state-of-the-art, and successful techniques and approaches. Questions addressed will include: What is the nature of the human mind? How do we get input from the world? How do we communicate? How do we change as infants and adults through experience? How do we make decisions and judgments? How do minds meet other minds in a social world?;"“Mind, Brain and Behavior: An Interdisciplinary Approach” (CLPS0010) is a writing-designated course consisting of lectures and one-hour sections that functions as a starting point in the CLPS department. It introduces psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, and linguistics through a broad study of the brain. Reviewers agreed no background in the subject was necessary to take this course, with most citing only high school psychology and familiarity with scientific literature as having helped them succeed.

Professor Elena Festa was commended by students for her effective presentation and enthusiasm. She encouraged and expected engagement from lecture attendees, and her lectures included frequent narratives and examples to support the theoretical content. Reviewers also noted her availability during office hours and willingness to meet by appointment. A few students stated they would have preferred clearer structure in Professor Festa’s lectures and slides.

CLPS0010 required readings before most lectures, a variety of online writing activities and assessments, three response papers reviewed by peers, and a final exam. Students found the assignments reasonably difficult as they were frequent and involved significant memorization. They stressed the importance of reviewing lecture notes regularly and completing work on time. The three papers built up progressively toward designing a scientific study, which respondents found valuable to their education.

Overall, students considered CLPS0010 a suitable introduction to the CLPS department. The course does not go in-depth on any one topic, so shoppers were urged to consider other lower-level courses in the department as narrower alternatives, such as “Making Decisions” (CLPS0220) or “Social Psychology” (CLPS0700).";10;24;1;1;0;1;0;1;0;9am;Morning

Cognitive and Psychology;CLPS 0300;Introduction to Linguistics;The ability to speak and understand a language involves having mastered (quite unconsciously) an intricate and highly structured rule-governed system. Linguists seek to model that rule system. This course introduces students to the areas of phonetics (speech articulation and transcription), phonology (the principles that govern how sounds are put together), morphology (the principles governing word structure), syntax (the rule system governing sentence structure), and semantics (the system that relates sentences to meanings).;"*Please note that this course was taught online – this review may not be reflective of future semesters*

“Introduction to Linguistics” (CLPS0300) is a course designed to provide a first exposure to “phonology (the principles that govern how sounds are put together), syntax (the rule system governing sentence structure), and semantics (the system that relates sentences to meanings).”The course has no official prerequisites, and many students said they enjoyed and did well in the class despite coming in with no prior linguistics background. A few said that some familiarity with a second language was helpful, but by no means necessary for success in this course.

Professor Scott AnderBois received praise from respondents for his ability to make sometimes “complex” and “esoteric” material accessible and for his willingness to accommodate a variety of student circumstances during the pandemic. Some students had concerns about the difficulty and disorganized lecture slides, but agreed that he compensated for the slides themselves with his enthusiasm during lecture. One reviewer said that the recorded lectures being broken up into smaller segments was particularly helpful for them in terms of “retaining my attention over a virtual setting.”

Coursework consisted of five homework assignments, weekly readings, one quiz, two exams, and a group project. Most respondents felt the workload was reasonable, although they cautioned that the exams were much harder than the homework despite testing the same material. Some students thought the instructions and guidelines surrounding the final project were confusing, but most agreed that the project was worthwhile and helpful for their learning.

Overall, respondents recommended CLPS0300 to concentrators and non-concentrators alike, and while they warned potential shoppers to be prepared to work hard, the overwhelming majority found the course to be worth the effort. As one student put it, “it’s a whole lot of fun and will make you think hard about this thing we call language that we take for granted.”";300;24;3;1;0;1;0;1;0;9am;Morning

Students become better informed consumers of empirical research and acquire a new framework for interpreting social behavior. Applications to historic and current events.;"Please note that this course was taught online – this review may not be reflective of future semesters*

“Social Psychology” (CLPS0700) covers “social cognition (person perception, attitudes), social influence (cultural sources of attitudes, conformity), and social relations (aggression, altruism, prejudice).” It is designed to help students “become better informed consumers of empirical research and acquire a new framework for interpreting social behavior.” The course has no official prerequisites, though reviewers said that previous psychology courses, including AP Psychology in high school, were helpful to their understanding but not necessary for their success.

Professor Oriel FeldmanHall received mixed comments from reviewers. Students emphasized that she was an excellent speaker and a knowledgeable researcher, and that the lectures were very engaging learning experiences. However, some felt that she could be not as understanding of individual circumstances at times. The majority of reviewers also reported that grading policies could be confusing, making the class “much more difficult than expected.”

Coursework consisted of readings for every lecture with five reading quizzes, one midterm, one final, and a research project. Many students said the work was difficult and that the readings were content-heavy and the exams required a great deal of memorization. Some complained that the grading on the exams and the project, and in particular the project proposal, was quite difficult. Respondents also stressed the importance of keeping up with the readings, as the course moved extremely quickly.

Students disagreed on whether to recommend the course; many found it interesting and worthwhile, but others felt it was more difficult. Overall, they said that those with a strong interest in psychology should shop the class, but non-concentrators or those without a high level of interest in the subject matter may find the class overwhelming at times.";700;24;5;1;0;1;0;1;0;1pm;Afternoon
Cognitive and Psychology;CLPS 0900;Statistical Methods;A survey of statistical methods used in the behavioral sciences. Topics include graphical data description, probability theory, confidence intervals, principles of hypothesis testing, analysis of variance, correlation, and regression, and techniques for categorical data. Emphasizes application of statistical methods to empirical data.;"“Statistical Methods” (CLPS0900) introduces students to statistical methods used in the behavioral sciences through an overview of basic descriptive statistics used to organize and analyze data as well as a focus on inferential statistics, which entails using sample statistics to estimate population parameters. There are no official prerequisites for CLPS0900, but students found a general background in statistics, particularly high school AP Statistics, and familiarity with the programming language R to be helpful.

Professor Costa was described as an organized and effective lecturer who made good use of module notes on Canvas. Students generally agreed that the instructor was skilled at explaining individual concepts, but some found it difficult to see how certain concepts related to one another, especially given the volume of content covered in the course. Students also found lectures to be “dry at times” and “a little repetitive” while others felt that the professor “rushed through material and read off [the] slides.” Nevertheless, Professor Costa was noted as being available for review sessions and during office hours “to help [students] understand the ‘big picture.’”

Assessments for CLPS0900 include weekly readings from the textbook, biweekly homework assignments, online Data Camp exercises for practicing R, one take-home midterm, and one take-home final exam. One student said that the textbook readings were “not very helpful,” but otherwise, very little was noted about how students viewed these assignments.

Overall, respondents found CLPS0900 to be an effective introduction to statistical methods for the purposes of the CLPS department. Several students noted that they would have appreciated a more comprehensive introduction to R as well as more general knowledge about this programming language beyond mere “slides and examples of problems.” One respondent noted that prospective students looking for a class with a focus on a different programming language or for a more math-based class “may want to look for something else.”";900;24;6;1;1;0;1;0;0;8:30am;Morning

Cognitive and Psychology;CLPS 1370;Pragmatics;Any time we utter a sentence in conversation, the perceived meaning of that sentence interacts with the discourse context in a rich variety of ways. On the one hand, aspects of a sentence's meaning are ``filled in'' or enriched by the prior conversation as well as non-linguistic context. On the other hand, utterances shape the future of the conversation in various ways too. This course is an introduction to the scientific study of such phenomena. Specific topics include: presupposition, implicature, speech acts, deixis, anaphora, (in)definiteness, and information structure.;;1370;24;11;2;0;1;0;1;0;1pm;Afternoon

Cognitive and Psychology;CLPS 1680F;Topics in Development: The Developmental and Evolutionary Origins of Mind;"Human behavior can sometimes appear strikingly different from other animals: we create complex tools, plan for the future, and have sophisticated cultural traditions and group behaviors. What cognitive processes underlie these behaviors, and to what extent are they shared with other animals or unique to humans (and is that even the right question to ask)? What ""counts"" as intelligence or as having a mind? To explore these exciting questions, we will examine research and theoretical perspectives from psychology, biology, behavioral ecology and philosophy, and look at diverse aspects of learning and cognition in human and non-human primates along with a sampling of other species.

Psychologists are primarily interested in detecting limits to human rationality, whereas economics tends to proceed within the rational-actor model. In business, questions arise of how theoretical models and empirical findings related to the practice of managerial decision-making. Investigations of power and the psychological impact of money are relatively recent additions to the suite of research topics. New methodologies, such as neuro-imaging have led to advances not represented in the traditional framework of organizational psychology. Enrollment limited to 20 junior and senior Psychology and Behavioral Decision Making concentrators.;;1730;24;16;2;0;1;0;1;0;9am;Morning

Comparative Literature;COLT 0510C;The World of Lyric Poetry;Lyric poetry is the prime mode for conveying emotion in many cultures, from ancient times to the present day. This course will survey the variety of forms and themes from the earliest texts from Greece, Rome, China and Japan, then the glories of the Renaissance and the Tang Dynasty, then move to the challenges for lyric expression in the modern world. Enrollment limited to 19 first year studens.;;510;11;1;1;3;3;3;3;3;3;3
Comparative Literature;COLT 0810G;Equity Law Literature Philosophy;Justice, rigorously applied, yields injustice. This paradox haunted Western aspirations toward legal and political justice from antiquity to the Renaissance. It necessitated the formulation of a complementary principle, equity, whose job it was to correct or supplement the law in cases where the strict application of it would lead to unfairness. In England, equity was enforced by a separate system of law, and it was a weighty, ambiguous term of great emotional force, with a particular appeal to Shakespeare. After its decline, Dickens and Kafka wrote two of the greatest literary works set in a world without equity.;N/A;810;11;2;1;0;1;0;1;0;9am;Morning
Comparative Literature;COLT 0810M;Uncanny Tales: Narratives of Repetition and Interruption;"What makes stories creepy? Close readings of short narratives with special attention to how formal and thematic elements interact to produce the effects of uncertainty, anxiety and incoherence peculiar to ""the uncanny."" Topics include: the representation of the self in images of the arts; the representation of speech; instabilities of identity and spatial and temporal boundaries; doubles, monsters, automata and hybrids. Texts selected from: Walpole, Shelley, Hoffmann, Kleist, Poe, Dostoyevsky, Freud, Wilde, Cortazar, Kafka, Lovecraft.";;810;11;3;1;3;3;3;3;3;3;3

Comparative Literature;COLT 1814S;The Balkans, Europe's Other?: Literature, Film, History;Introduces the modern Balkans through a critical examination of literary and visual, historiographic and political, narratives. The course considers the contestation over a shared historical past and interreligious geographic space through common and divergent master narratives, motifs, myths, and recurring discourses. It also examines the region’s aesthetic, religious, and political relation to Europe. Do the Balkans constitute a traumatized, “balkanized,” self-colonized, abject modernity at Europe’s edges, its inner alterity? Given the acclaim achieved by Balkan filmmakers since 1989, the course also asks how Balkan artists, caught in-between nationalism, Orientalism, Eurocentrism and globalization, assert agency and subjectivity and captivate our imaginations.;;1814;11;5;2;0;1;0;0;0;4pm;Afternoon

Comparative Literature;COLT 1815X;Censorship;Who decides what we read and view? Censorship has a long history in authoritarian states and religious institutions, but where else has it taken shape, today and in the past? This course engages with a series of once “banned” literary and artistic works alongside creative and legal critiques of censorship. Addressing recent forms of censorship in the arts and the political sphere - exhibit closings, book burnings, redaction, classification - and the acts of protest, whistle-blowing, and document-dumping that aim to circumvent these, the course explores ideas of public interest, national defense, and decency that underpin decisions to restrict.;;1815;11;7;2;1;0;1;0;0;8:30am;Morning
Comparative Literature;COLT 2822M;Thinking Through Comparison: Han and Roman Empires;This seminar introduces students to comparative methods in the study of antiquity, with a focus on Han China and the Roman Empire. We will consider how and why we do comparative history, through the examples of the Han Chinese and Roman Empires. Sessions will consider existing examples of comparative work on these two ancient cultures from the eighteenth century to today, asking what questions the scholars involved were asking and what methodologies they brought to bear to answer them. Using a balance of ancient and modern readings, we will ask what the purpose of comparison is and what methodologies comparisons demand, as well as conducting our own comparative research informed by the most recent scholarship on both civilisations. No knowledge required of ancient European languages or ancient or modern Chinese languages.;;2822;11;8;3;0;1;0;1;0;1pm;Afternoon
Comparative Literature;COLT 2822N;Proust and Benjamin;This seminar examines works by two twentieth-century authors who contributed richly to the modernist literary and philosophical project of thinking and writing about time, and what it means to live in time. Our main task will be to read all seven volumes of Marcel Proust’s magnum opus In Search of Lost Time, but we’ll also read Walter Benjamin’s short but densely poetic Berlin Childhood Around 1900, as well as a few essays by Benjamin on Proust and on time and history. A reading knowledge of French or German would be an asset, but is not required.;;2822;11;9;3;0;0;0;0;1;3pm;Afternoon

Contemporary Studies;COST 0120;The Classical Chinese Philosophy of Life;An introduction to the origins and early development of the indigenous religious thought of China from the oracle bone divination of the Shang Dynasty to the ethical philosophy of Confucianism and the cosmology and mysticism of Daoism. The course will seek to identify and elucidate the basic elements of the distinctive Chinese world view and demonstrate how they have shaped the nature of religious practice and experience and how they have been shaped by them. Works of interpretive scholarship will be used to supplement the primary texts in translation that will form the course. Optional lab section.;;120;6;1;1;3;3;3;3;3;3;3
Contemporary Studies;COST 0140;Food, Religion and Politics in South Asia;Why study food? What can food tell us about religion, politics, and culture? Food in South Asia often shapes identity, social status, ritual purity, religious belonging, and political activism—the notion that you are what you eat has wide currency. Whatever form it takes, food embodies histories of migration, trade, empire, colonialism, and ethics. Through reading primary texts and ethnographic articles, watching films, and (of course) eating delicious food, we will explore the rich foodways of South Asia and their social, religious, and political ramifications.;;140;6;2;1;3;3;3;3;3;3;3
Contemporary Studies;COST 0145;Karma, Rebirth and Liberation: Life and Death in South Asian Religions;"Karma, Sanskrit for the ""action"" that makes up a human life, has been a central concern for the religious traditions of South Asia throughout their history. Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism share the belief that after death people are reborn, taking on lives according to their actions in lives previous. In these traditions, liberation from the cycle of rebirth becomes the ultimate goal of human existence. This course examines the ideas of karma, rebirth and liberation in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism from historical, cosmological, ritual, narrative, iconographic and theological points of view. We also look at these ideas in Western culture.";"Interested in studying rebirth and karma, which are present in many South Asian religious traditions? Then you should consider taking “Karma, Liberation + Rebirth” (RELS0145) with Professor Finnian Moore-Gerety! This seminar studies karma in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism from a variety of perspectives, including through historical, theological, and ritual lenses. There are no official prerequisites for this course, and students reported that none are necessary except for an open and inquiring mind.

Professor Moore-Gerety split the class into lectures and discussions, both of which students enjoyed. Survey respondents praised his energy and passion for the subject, stating that it came across in his engaging lectures. In addition, reviewers liked how Professor Moore-Gerety encouraged people to discuss their own ideas and generate their own answers to questions, rather than doing all the talking himself. However, some respondents commented that the discussions could be lackluster if students hadn’t done the readings in advance. Students reported that Professor Moore-Gerety provided timely, specific, and helpful feedback on papers, while meetings with him outside of class were friendly and useful.

Class assignments consisted of weekly readings and two-page reflection papers, in addition to midterm and final papers. Students reported that the weekly assignments “required a good amount of thinking” and forced them to form opinions about the topics studied. While the readings and papers took a certain amount of time and thought, survey respondents found them very relevant to the course and useful for stimulating class discussion, even though they were difficult for some students.

Overall, students enjoyed this class, praising the thought-provoking readings and class discussions and engaging lectures. Respondents suggested that the class meet more than once a week in the future and also advised students to stay on top of the work, as it was easy to fall behind. If you are interested in the topic and have enough time in your schedule, consider shopping “Karma, Liberation + Rebirth” if you’re looking for “a fun, informative and perspective broadening course” that one student reported “has helped shape my view on a broad array of subjects in my day to day life.”";145;6;3;2;0;1;0;0;0;4pm;Afternoon
Contemporary Studies;COST 0520;Tai Chi, Qigong, and Traditions of Energy Cultivation in China;In recent years Taijiquan (Tai Chi) and Qigong have become increasingly popular forms of exercise, alternative medicine and contemplative practice. This course aims to provide students with a foundation for understanding these practices through an exploration of their roots in Chinese medicine, philosophy and religion, as well as their more recent history in modern China and the rest of the world. In addition to studying historical and scholarly interpretations of these practices, students will also have the opportunity to learn basic Qigong and Taijiquan in weekly labs.;;520;6;4;2;3;3;3;3;3;3;3
Contemporary Studies;COST 1082;Me, Myself, and I: Exploring Senses of Self from a Multidisciplinary Perspective;Human beings have long puzzled over how precisely to conceptualize and understand what and how it is that we are. Questions about the nature of the self have informed the speculations of philosophy, the soteriologies of religion, the trajectories of self-cultivation in contemplative traditions, and the therapeutics of psychology. Recently, cognitive science and phenomenology have developed new explanations for how multiple senses of self shape lived experience and give rise to various self-concepts. Students in this course will engage with dimensions of selfhood that we often take for granted by studying senses of self from multidisciplinary and cross-cultural perspectives.;;1082;6;5;3;0;1;0;1;0;4pm;Afternoon

Other topics include artificial intelligence, IT security, ethics and the economics of computing as well as the effects of its pervasiveness in today's world. Introductory programming and analytic skills are developed through Excel, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python assignments. CSCI0020 is a good introduction to a wide range of CS topics that have broad relevance in our society. No prerequisites. Cannot be taken to fulfill CS Concentration.;"“The Digital World” (CSCI0020) provides an overview of the history of our digital world and teaches students the basics of a wide range of programming languages, including Python and HTML. There are no prerequisites to this course and many reviewers noted that they gained a lot from this class without any prior knowledge or experience.

Students described Professor Stanford as knowledgeable and engaging. Reviewers enjoyed his clear and organized PowerPoints, and thought he was fun and interesting. Some wished he was more available outside of classes, but noted that the TAs were very useful when students needed help with assignments.

Course requirements included weekly homeworks, projects, a midterm, and a final. Students are also required to attend lab sections to prepare them for the homework assignments. Some reviewers noted that the class lectures and exams were not relevant to the homework assignments and labs, and wished there was more of a connection between all aspects of the course.

Overall, reviewers recommend this course to all students, whether they are interested in computer science or not. Students learned a lot about the rise of technology in this course and noted that the material is interesting and relevant to everyone.";20;43;1;1;0;1;0;1;0;9am;Morning
Computer Science;CSCI 0111;Computing Foundations: Data;An introduction to computing and programming that focuses on understanding and manipulating data. Students will learn to write programs to process both tabular and structured data, to assess programs both experimentally and theoretically, to apply basic data science concepts, and to discuss big ideas around the communication, use, and social impacts of digital information. Designed for both concentrators and non-concentrators, this is the first course in either a two- or three-course introductory sequence leading into advanced CS courses. Programming assignments will be smaller scale than in CSCI 0150/0170, thus allowing students time to practice programming and discuss computational ideas in a broader context.;"“Computing Foundations: Data” (CSCI0111) is an introductory computer science course that focuses on understanding and manipulating data. Taught by Professors Kathi Fisler and Milda Zizyte, the course is designed for both CS concentrators and non-concentrators who want to step into the field of data and computing. It features smaller-scale assignments that are comparatively more “gentle” than other intro sequence courses, such as CSCI 0170 or CSCI 0150. The course does not have any prerequisites and does not require any prior coding experience.

The teaching styles of both instructors were found to be generally effective. The respondents thought the professors were approachable, accommodating, and passionate about the class which made attending lectures enjoyable. Professor Fisler's “humming” method—where the professor would ask students to hum instead of raising their hand in response to classwide questions—was particularly helpful in allowing students to give immediate feedback. However, some respondents believed that example questions that are provided in class often are not useful since there is a significant “leap in difficulty” between homework and lecture material. Generally, students heavily recommended the use of TA hours to supplement lectures and resolve confusion but warned that the long queues meant that assignments can take days to finish.

Coursework for “Computing Foundations: Data” included seven homework assignments, group and individual projects, weekly labs, two weekly quizzes, a take-home midterm, and an in-person final exam. Students had mixed responses on the grading scheme of the course, with some stating that one simply needs to put in the work and go to office hours to perform well and others believing that the opaque and sometimes untested auto graders created frustration.

Overall, the respondents noted that TA hours were extremely helpful, and using EdStem was very important in understanding the course material and getting questions answered about the assignments. Students emphasized that the course is very time-consuming but is a great chance to gain introductory skills in computer science.";111;43;2;1;1;0;1;0;1;1pm;Afternoon
Computer Science;CSCI 0112;Computing Foundations: Program Organization;Explores how organization of programs, data, and algorithms affects metrics such as time performance, space usage, social impacts, and data privacy. Students will learn how to choose between candidate data structures for a problem, how to write programs over several standard data structures, how to assess the quality of programs (from theoretical, practical, and social perspectives), and how to apply their skills to computational problems that could arise in a variety of fields. The course will teach object-oriented programming, in combination with basic functional and imperative programming concepts. The course is designed for both concentrators and non-concentrators. Prerequisite: CSCI 0111;"Computing Foundations: Program Organization” (CSCI0112) is the class to take for those interested in how algorithms, data, and programs factor into data structures, and for anyone who wants to earn valuable computational skills. The course teaches students object-oriented programming, as well as basic functional and imperative programming concepts. Students explore how the organization of programs, data, and algorithms affects metrics such as time performance, space, and data privacy. Students can expect to leave this course with knowledge about how to choose between candidate data structures when approaching a problem, experience writing programs over several standard data structures, the ability to assess the quality of programs from multiple perspectives, and skills they can apply to a wide variety of computational problems. It is important to note that this course does have ""Computing Foundations: Data” (CSCI0111) as a prerequisite, and that previous students suggested that experience coding in Python would be helpful.

Students praised Professor Nelson, highlighting his clear passion for the material and ability to engage students in lectures. Students consistently lauded the usefulness of in-class drills and his flexibility during discussion and lecture, which allowed students to tune the class to their interests. Students also appreciated that Professor Nelson showed interest in their studies outside of CS, describing him as a “nice guy who cares about his students and is very enthusiastic about what he is teaching.”

Assignments for CSCI0112 consisted of weekly labs, three group projects, a few drills on Gradescope graded for completion, and weekly coding assignments on weeks where no projects were assigned. The class culminated in a final project that students could complete as a group or individually. Reviewers expressed that the overall workload was quite manageable, especially compared to other intro CS classes, and that the TAs and Professor Nelson provided ample assistance to students with homework problems and provided helpful guidance for projects.

All in all, the majority of reviewers enjoyed taking CSCI0112. Some reviewers did note that some of the more specific lectures, such as one on how Python works, may be interesting, but not helpful to non-concentrators. Overall, though, students saw this course as a worthwhile experience, with one explaining, “I had a really good experience in this class and even though you learn a lot, it's not as intense as the other intro CS classes so it's good for anyone who wants to learn more about coding.”";112;43;3;1;1;0;1;0;1;1pm;Afternoon
Computer Science;CSCI 0150;Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming and Computer Science;Introduces programming in Java (a modern, widely-used programming language), interactive 2D computer graphics, and some fundamental data structures and algorithms. Students learn by programming a sequence of interactive graphics programs which gradually increase in complexity, including Doodle Jump, Tetris (http://bastilleweb.techhouse.org/), and a significant final project. Lectures are supplemented by skits performed by the UTAs (Undergraduate Teaching Assistants) to teach course concepts and for a bit of added entertainment! This course is intended for both potential concentrators and those who may take only a single course. There are NO prerequisites, and no prior knowledge of programming is required, though students who do have prior programming experience are also encouraged to take the course!;"“Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming and Computer Science” (CSCI0150) is an introductory computer science course designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike. Students learn the basics of Java programming through educational, coding projects. There are no official prerequisites for this course. Although many students found that no background was required, they found that some found that it would be good to know some basic programming concepts to adjust to the fast-paced, work-heavy course.

The reviews for the instructor were overall positive. Students praised Professor Andries ‘Andy’ van Dam for his clear passion for the course. They also found entertainment in the short skits that kept them engaged in the classes. Though students felt that the speed of the lecture was fast, they felt that it was necessary because of the large amount of content covered throughout the semester. The students noted that labs and TA hours were especially helpful in reinforcing the concepts taught in the lecture as Andy would often not be available for assistance.

In terms of assignments, there were eight individual projects (counting the final project), two group projects, and weekly lab assignments. Students found that the individual assignments “progressively got more difficult” and required more time; however, they also expressed that it wasn’t an unreasonable demand and that it was rewarding in the end.

Overall, student’s had a positive impression on the course. Students appreciated the fun environment in this course. There is a little bit of everything from this course: from SRC presentations, lectures, stretch breaks, and engaging skits. Some advice would be to make full use of the conceptual and debugging hours as early as possible because they are very helpful. Though this is an introductory course, it is great to be mindful that it should be considered with a more serious thought.";150;43;4;1;1;0;1;0;1;9am;Morning
Computer Science;CSCI 0170;Computer Science: An Integrated Introduction;"CSCI0170/0180 is an introductory sequence that helps students begin to develop the skills, knowledge, and confidence to solve computational problems elegantly, correctly, efficiently, and with ease. The sequence is unique in teaching both the functional and imperative programming paradigms---the first through the languages Scheme and ML in CSCI0170; the second through Java in CSCI0180. The sequence requires no previous programming experience. Indeed, few high school students are exposed to functional programming; hence even students with previous programming experience often find this sequence an invaluable part of their education.

Although students are taught to use programming languages as tools, the goal of CSCI0170/0180 is not merely to teach programming. On the contrary, the goal is to convey to students that computer science is much more than programming! All of the following fundamental computer science techniques are integrated into the course material: algorithms, data structures, analysis, problem solving, abstract reasoning, and collaboration. Concrete examples are drawn from different subareas of computer science: in 0170, from arbitrary-precision arithmetic, natural language processing, databases, and strategic games; in 0180, from discrete-event simulation, data compression, and client/server architectures.";"Computer Science: An Integrated Introduction” (CSCI0170) is an introductory computer science course that teaches functional and imperative programming through two languages: Dr. Racket and ReasonML. It stands to reason that the course is more about learning how to use programming rather than how to program. There is no requirement for background knowledge, and there is no official prerequisite. In fact, reviewers note that it could be a hindrance to know about computer science as it approaches the field through a different perspective.

Students had mixed reviews about the effectiveness of the instructor’s teaching methods. They praised Professor John F. ""Spike"" Hughes for his genuine passion and use of in-class examples and demonstrations. However, they also noted that his lecture was a mix of “meticulous detail on unimportant things” and brevity on important things. For the content that wasn’t addressed sufficiently in lecture, students found the labs and homework to be helpful in filling in the gaps.

In this course, there are weekly homework and lab assignments, three group projects, and a take-home exam. Students found the assignments to be time-consuming and conceptually difficult but rewarding. On these assignments, many praised the TAs for being helpful in answering questions and breaking down the problem. On average, students spent multiple hours a week outside of class and also attended weekly two-hour labs as a part of the course.

Overall, students found this course to be rigorous “but the learning is unparalleled.” It is very important to pay attention to the details in this class. One piece of advice for prospective students is to prepare well for the final exam as it is difficult. More importantly, having a strong grasp on time management is described as crucial for succeeding in this class.";170;43;5;1;1;0;1;0;1;11am;Morning
Computer Science;CSCI 0190;Accelerated Introduction to Computer Science;A one-semester introduction to CS covering programming integrated with core data structures, algorithms, and analysis techniques, similar to the two-course introductory sequences (CSCI 0150-0200 and CSCI 0170-0200). All students wishing to take CSCI 0190, irrespective of prior preparation, must pass a sequence of online placement assignments during the summer. Though the placement process is most appropriate for students who have had some prior programming experience, it is self-contained so all are welcome to try learning the provided material and attempting placement. Placement information will be available by June 1st at  http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0190/. Students who do not successfully pass the placement process won't be allowed to register.;"“Accelerated Introduction to Computer Science” (CSCI0190) is an introductory-level computer science course that covers core data structures, algorithms, and analysis techniques with the language Pyret. Students noted that no formal background was needed but it was useful to have prior computing knowledge. Though there isn’t a prerequisite requirement for the course, a sequence of online placement exams must be passed prior to enrollment in this course.

Students praised Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi for his ability to engage the students. For example, he employed tactics to try “not to call on people more than once or twice” and asked the students to hum to answer questions posed throughout the class. Students noted that he treated everyone equally without letting anyone show off, and inspired them to think critically about how lectures applied to their assignments. It is hard to reach Professor Shriram outside of lectures, but TA staff are available to answer any questions.

In total, there are two optional SRC readings, weekly labs, 13 individual projects, three group projects, and one optional group project. Many assignments took place in less than a week and were work intensive. So, it is critical to be able to work at a rigorous pace. There is a lot of self-teaching required in this course because the lectures and books are often useful to an extent. Many reviews noted taking upwards of 20 hours per week to sufficiently stay on top of the course load. However, these assignments were designed to help students learn programming, and students found themselves improving “an incredible amount” throughout the course.

Overall, students had a lot of positive reviews for this course. It is rigorous, but it is also rewarding. One piece of advice from several students is to consider their overall course schedule and be prepared to spend a lot of time on this course. The first few weeks will be challenging, but it is a workload that prospective students will be able to get accustomed to.";190;43;6;1;1;0;1;0;1;9am;Morning

Survey respondents gave varying feedback about Professor Jenkins. There were few lectures; the class was mostly independent-work based, with the professor giving feedback. One student said he was challenged appropriately. Additionally, reviewers felt that their needs were taken into account. However, one class member though the instructor's expectations were unreasonable while another wrote that discussions sometimes went out of control.

One person cited the sole textbook for the course as useful, and no one else had comments on it. The class required two introductory assignments, six short assignments, and one large, final project.

Class members spent varying amounts of time on the course, ranging from 2 to 20 hours, with most reviewers spending around 10 to 15 hours per week. For some, this was too much time, while others said this was acceptable. Several survey respondents wrote that prospective students should take the course with friends. Additionally, many had cautionary notes about the project: ""Don't make a project with high expectations - you won't finish"" and ""Decide on a final project early.""

Attention will be given to contestations over space, IT infrastructure, architectural spaces, and the emergence of new subjectivities.;N/A;533;8;4;2;0;1;0;1;0;9am;Morning
Eastern Studies;EAST 1307;Sex and Society in Modern China.;"This course traces changing gender relations across China’s “long 20th century.” We begin by examining lives and relationships of men and women in the late 19th century, before the fall of the Qing dynasty. We then investigate the ways that external and indigenous forces have changed (or not) gender relationships during the rapid and often violent transitions of the twentieth century, from the Republican period (1911-1949) to the People’s Republic; from the Nanjing Decade (1927-37) to the Maoist period (1950-1976) and the period of economic reform (1976-present day). Why did Chinese politicians see the reform of family and gender relations as central to their larger political goals? What were the “new” gender relations supposed to be? How was gender reform carried out (or not) and what were its effects, intended and unintended?";;1307;8;5;2;3;3;3;3;3;3;3

This course examines the arrival of “Korea” globally, from the West’s fascination with the North Korean nuclear crises, to the hype around KPop, KFilm, cosmetics, food, and eSports. We will question the fascination with NK in US media outlets, versus its treatment in SK media. The ways in which the particular, local, and authentic, within Korean cultural production negotiates the global market is of particular interest.;;1502;8;7;3;3;3;3;3;3;3;3

Economics;ECON 0110;Principles of Economics;Extensive coverage of economic issues, institutions, and terminology, plus an introduction to economic analysis and its application to current social problems. Required for all economics concentrators. Prerequisite for ECON 1110, 1130, 1210 and 1620. Serves as a general course for students who will take no other economics courses and want a broad introduction to the discipline. Weekly one-hour conference required.;"“Principles of Economics” (ECON0110) is an introductory-level economics course taught by Professor Rachel Friedberg which provides broad coverage of economics issues, institutions, and terminology. It serves as a requirement for all economics concentrators and as a prerequisite for many upper-level economics courses. Although ECON0110 is an introductory course, students noted that a background in mathematics was helpful.

Professor Friedberg was described by students as a strong lecturer who was able to explain concepts and reading material in a clear and concise manner. She was praised for her ability to break down difficult ideas into manageable chunks and present practice problems with comprehensive explanations. Some respondents noted that she did not post lecture content online after class, but one student found that to be an incentive to attend class.

Assignments included weekly readings and homework assignments, but the majority of a student’s grade was attributed to three midterms and one final. Students noted that exams could be deceptively challenging due to their format and stated that it was imperative to take practice exams to familiarize oneself with them.

Overall, students reported that ECON0110 was helpful in attaining a general and broad understanding of economics. One student reported the workload as being procedural and predictable. Therefore, as long as a student manages their time well, they should be able to handle the workload the course requires.";110;47;1;1;1;0;1;0;1;12pm;Afternoon
Economics;ECON 0170;Essential Mathematics for Economics;"This course teaches the mathematical skills useful for upper level Economics classes. Emphasis is on acquisition of tools, problem solving, intuition, and applications rather than proofs.

This course satisfies the mathematics requirement for the Economics concentration, but does not serve as a prerequisite for upper level courses in Math, Applied Math, or other departments. Students planning further courses in those areas should take MATH 0100 or MATH 0170 (which also satisfy the Economics concentration requirement) instead. Ideally, ECON 0170 should be taken before ECON 1110, or at least simultaneously.";"*Please note that this course was taught online – this review may not be reflective of future semesters*

If you’re looking to learn college-level mathematics in a way that feels more relevant to economics, you might enjoy “Essential Mathematics for Economics” (ECON0170)! This course covers calculus and other topics relevant to upper-level study in economics. As opposed to the standard mathematics progression, ECON0170 places more emphasis on problem-solving and applications and less on proofs. The course’s official prerequisite is one introductory calculus course, such as MATH0060, MATH0070, MATH0090, or AP Calculus AB. Reviewers generally felt that basic calculus knowledge from any of these sources, along with “Principles of Economics” (ECON0110), was helpful background for this course.

Professor Alex Poterack was overwhelmingly considered a concise and effective lecturer, with different reviewers calling his teaching style “irreproachable,” “timely,” and “to the point.” This year, all lectures were asynchronous, but students greatly appreciated the easily digestible lengths of the videos and Professor Poterack’s use of worthwhile examples, connections to economic concepts, and worksheets between lecture videos. Some respondents, however, noted that the course’s asynchronous format made it hard to work with other students.

The coursework for ECON0170 included six problem sets, three exams, and optional weekly readings. The homework was considered effective in solidifying understanding of course content, and respondents felt that it took a reasonable amount of time to complete as long as one consistently followed the lectures. One reviewer particularly praised the course’s organization and found it easy to keep track of course expectations.

Based especially on Professor Poterack’s teaching style but inclusive of all elements of the course, reviewers highly recommended ECON0170 as an alternative math-heavy course to MATH0100, though they noted it should generally only be taken by those considering an economics concentration. The only suggestion made by reviewers was to consider including a synchronous component to the course. In addition to shopping “Introductory Calculus, Part II” (MATH0100), students recommended taking “Intermediate Microeconomics” (ECON1110) alongside or after ECON0170.";170;47;2;1;1;0;1;0;1;12pm;Afternoon

Economics;ECON 1385;Intergenerational Poverty in America;In the US, the children of poor parents are eight times more likely to grow up to be poor than the children of high-income parents. What accounts for this? In this course we try to answer this question by examining how poverty influences child development and, ultimately, their income and wellbeing in adulthood. We will begin the course with an overview of poverty and intergenerational mobility in America, looking at historical trends and placing the US in international context. To understand why poverty is persistent across generations in the US, we begin with the economic model of skill formation in childhood. We then consider the existing research exploring how a number of factors explain the intergenerational persistence of poverty, including parental time, pollution, infant and child health, the justice system, neighborhoods, stress, and preschool/education systems. This course will involve reading and discussion of economic research and a final independent research project that will require data analysis and the application of empirical methods students have learned in econ 1629/1630.;;1385;47;15;1;0;1;0;1;0;1pm;Afternoon

Economics;ECON 1487;Translating Evidence into Economic Policy;The objective of this course is, precisely, to offer those insights to students interested in a career in policymaking by providing case studies of the most important and challenging policy questions of our lifetimes. By the end of the course students will have deepened their understanding of the most important policy challenges from an array of different contexts and the evidence around them, with a special focus on quantitative methods useful to analyze those questions. This class is particularly designed for students that have already studied some of the basic econometric methods, but feel they could get a better understanding of them when looking at them in the context of actual, real-life, policy challenges.;"“Policy Questions and Quantitative Methods to Explore Them” (MPA2605) is a graduate-level course that discusses the challenges of policy making in both domestic and international contexts, with a specific focus on quantitatively analyzing those challenges. Enrollment is limited to students in the Master of Public Affairs program. Reviewers recommended having done previous statistical analysis work.

MPA2605 was taught by Professor Dany Bahar. He received overwhelmingly positive reviews for both his enthusiasm for the course material and for being very receptive to the needs of students. Reviews also enjoyed how Professor Bahar would link policy topics to their backgrounds. Class discussions were found to be very helpful for understanding the material.

The workload for this course consisted of three to four weekly readings, three papers, and two projects. Both the papers and projects were on topics of the students' choosing.

Overall, students greatly enjoyed this course. One respondent explained, “I loved all of it because there was a mix of students with varying backgrounds and ways of participating so it was interesting to hear people's opinions.” Another student said that this is “a great course to practice econometric tools for evaluating and advocating for policy.”";1487;47;19;2;1;0;0;0;0;3pm;Afternoon

English;ENGL 0300P;Dreams;“Why do we dream?” may be an intriguing question, but ultimately one for science to answer. On the other hand, “What can we do with dreams?” is a question that people have approached from an almost limitless number of perspectives over thousands of years. Whether envisioned as a source of philosophical insight, a refuge for unspeakable desires, or an experience to be intentionally manipulated, the space of the dream is an unfailingly fascinating one-- and the works that have been created to explore it are equally as fascinating. In this course, we will engage with various cultural texts about dreams, which may include: The Dream of Scipio (Cicero), the Parliament of Fowls (Chaucer), Godless but Loyal to Heaven (Van Camp), Paprika (Kon), and Inception (Nolan).

Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway, along with some contemporary American writers who played a role in influencing the two authors. Respondents mentioned that English classes in high school were helpful, but that no formal background was expected or required.

Students generally concluded that Professor Stuart Burrows was engaging and passionate and that his lectures were enjoyable. Reviewers also added that he was very knowledgeable about these two authors and was often able to provide detailed descriptions of contextual information in each text. However, some respondents stated that this sometimes led the lectures off-topic as he then covered authors and texts that were not within the scope of the class. Additionally, some reviewers also mentioned that even though his lectures were engaging, the fact that he read off of his notes throughout the class made his lectures slightly less effective. Outside of class, Professor Burrows had flexible office hours and responded to student emails promptly.

The semester's assignments were broken down mainly into three papers of length three, five, and seven pages. Students were also expected to attend weekly section and do the readings. Respondents said that the papers were weighted heavily in calculating their overall grade and, hence, should be taken seriously. They also responded that though the reading load was heavy, it was very relevant to class and section discussions and suggested that students should keep up with it.

A few students suggested that this course could be improved with shorter assignments that were more spread out, as well as more help and guidance regarding the expected structure, style, and content of the papers. Overall, reviewers concluded that this course provided a very good exposition to many classic novels and suggested students also shop other such courses in the English Department";710;47;5;1;1;0;1;0;1;11am;Morning

Readings from a wide range of texts in literature, the media, and academic disciplines. Assignments move from personal response papers to formal academic essays. Enrollment limited to 17. Banner registrations after classes begin require instructor approval. S/NC.;"“Critical Reading and Writing I: The Academic Essay” (ENGL0900) provides an introduction to university-level writing. Given its intent as an introductory course, no prior experience is necessary. Respondents compared the course to an advanced high school English course, with one student saying that it is not very different from AP Language or AP Literature. ENGL0900 is a mandatory S/NC class that is capped at 17 students per section.

Overall, students highly praised Professor Robert Ward for being personable and dedicated. One student exclaimed, “Professor Ward deeply cares about his students,” with another echoing, “He was so kind and gentle.” A respondent described Professor Ward’s teaching as a “hands-off approach” in which students would lead conferences and learn on their own, with the professor providing helpful suggestions and feedback. Describing Professor Ward’s tireless devotion to students, one class member said: “For every essay, he would have you submit a draft and then give his own feedback in writing and in a conference with each student. He will cancel class, have asynchronous work due, and take his whole day to meet with each student individually. He is extremely thoughtful and wants to help everyone improve their writing.”

Course requirements for ENGL0900 include weekly readings with occasional reading responses, occasional asynchronous discussion during essay conferences, intermittent quizzes on MLA formatting, four papers, and one presentation. The topics for the four papers were freewriting, metawriting, literary analysis, and argumentative writing. Reviewers commended Professor Ward’s very detailed and thoughtful feedback on essays. The course material itself was cited as not very challenging, with some students wishing it had pushed their writing towards more substantial change. While respondents enjoyed assigned readings, they did not necessarily enjoy the in-class activities where they had to write something together with classmates.

What made this section of “Critical Reading and Writing I” so special? Professor Ward! One student praised, “the class itself is quite a normal English class. What makes it enjoyable is Professor Ward, who is an amazing professor.” Reviewers continually noted the benefits of ENGL0900 being S/NC. With the workload cited as not particularly hard, the S/NC “takes all pressure on writing the correct essay and instead allows you to make mistakes and grow.” While the course is not stressful, at times students wished it was more challenging. With that, students said “you get out what you put in,” but overall, students felt it was interesting and helpful in gaining a better perspective on writing.";900;47;8;1;1;0;1;0;1;12pm;Afternoon

The class can serve as preparation for any 1000-level nonfiction writing course within the English department, and it is mandatory S/NC.

Students described Professor Michael Stewart as incredibly approachable. They praised his knowledge of “the most random topics” and appreciated his valuable comments on written assignments, which students described as pleasantly constructive without being mean. In addition, respondents noted Professor Stewart’s spirited demeanor and indicated that he was incredibly responsive to student needs and feedback.

The course consisted of weekly reading and writing exercises. Students were also required to write five papers throughout the semester. As one student noted, the class focused on improving writing skills, and there were no penalties for writing something bad, which made for a class environment that encouraged risk-taking.

Overall, respondents praised this class as a must-take. Students commented that anyone could learn from the course, regardless of writing level. One student particularly enjoyed that the assignments focused on tangible skills, stating that the class was “especially worthwhile if you’re willing to take risks with your writing and subject material!”";930;47;9;1;0;1;0;1;0;2:30pm;Afternoon

Engineering;ENGN 0032;Introduction to Engineering: Design;This course is an introduction to the engineering profession with an emphasis on design. It is a project-based class which consists of three major design projects. Working in small groups, students leverage the design process and engineering discipline to present solutions to three design briefs. In weekly studio sessions, students will learn different tools (e.g., Matlab) associated with engineering and design. ENGN 0032 provides the foundation for further study in engineering. This class is designed for students who have a strong interest in design or are unsure of their interest in engineering. Students should have a math background (AB calculus).;"Interested in the design of products, services, and systems? “Introduction to Engineering: Design” (ENGN0032) is an introductory engineering course with a design twist. The class is comprised of lectures, supplementary sections, weekly homework, and projects. As with “Introduction to Engineering,” (ENGN0030), ENGN0032 is a mandatory S/NC class. As an introductory class, respondents did not feel any prerequisite classes were necessary, though students with some high school physics background were initially more comfortable with the engineering work.

Professor Michael Donohue was noted for his passion for design and connecting with students. His teaching style was described as very hands-on and interactive, and respondents found participation in lecture discussions extremely beneficial. Several respondents found his stories to be engaging and practical and considered him as a valuable design resource, especially for projects. However, his lectures only covered “big-picture” design concepts, while engineering components of the course were covered in sections by undergraduate TAs, which some found made the engineering problem sets difficult.

The workload is comprised of weekly design or engineering homework as well as group projects. The engineering problem sets, in particular, could be disorganized. In general, the problem sets could be time-intensive, but the S/NC nature of the class meant the grades were less emphasized. The projects were considered particularly time-consuming but rewarding as they trained both creative and technical skills.

Respondents believed that ENGN0032 offered a new, non-traditional perspective on engineering, and one student wrote that it has made them consider concentrating in Engineering. Non-concentrators who took the class still found the skills and experiences in the class very useful. Many noted that ENGN0032 is a relatively new and constantly evolving class and that Professor Donohue was very open to improving the class with student feedback. If you plan on developing any products or systems, ENGN0032 is a great class to consider.";32;60;1;1;0;1;0;1;0;1pm;Afternoon

There is one math prerequisite (MATH 0100, 0170, 0180, 0200, 0350, or 0190) and one chemistry prerequisite (CHEM 0100 or 0330).

Course instruction consisted of both problem-solving and lecture, which were mixed between presentation slides and handwritten notes. Respondents described Professor Kurt Pennel's teaching style as extremely passionate and effective, noting that he was very successful in accommodating both in-person and remote students. Reviewers also praised Professor Pennel for being very available and responsive to students, providing helpful feedback and always making everyone feel supported.

Course requirements consisted of one to two readings per week, five homework assignments (four required and one extra credit), three exams, three labs, and a final project. Students found assignments to be reasonable and worthwhile, noting that although there was a significant amount of work, the workload was manageable as assignments were very fair and directly based on material discussed in class.

All respondents reported having a positive experience in ENGN0490, with many commenting that Professor Pennel's passion truly made the class special. Students encourage potential shoppers to take the course, noting that it provides many opportunities for application, and therefore feels more 'real world' and intersectional than any other engineering classes.";490;60;8;1;0;1;0;1;0;1pm;Afternoon

Formal prerequisites for the course include MATH0180, 0200, or 0350 and either PHYS0040, 0060, 0160, or 0080. Another helpful course noted by students is “Analytical Mechanics” (PHYS0070).

Professor Koushiappas was overwhelmingly described as being passionate about subject materials and as an effective lecturer in class. Many students appreciated his teaching style and how he incorporated live demonstrations into lessons. Some respondents wished he would answer questions in a more clear-cut manner, but they all agreed that he was open to questions.

Assignments for “Electricity and Magnetism” consist of regular readings, weekly problem sets, one midterm exam, four labs, and one final exam. Readings were considered important for success in class and key to lecture understanding. Students noted that labs helped them explore content effectively. The knowledge could sometimes be challenging, but staying up to date with class materials, going to office hours, and studying diligently for exams helped improve performance in the class.

Overall, reviewers enjoyed Professor Koushiappas's teaching style for PHYS0470 and praised his enthusiasm. Students believed the class was worth it, as long as prospective shoppers had an interest in physics and were willing to explore more.

The course’s prerequisites are multivariable calculus, a course in differential equations, and either ENGN0040 or an introductory physics course. Of these, students found calculus and physics the most necessary to succeed.

The course was co-taught by Professors Daniel Harris and Roberto Zenit, both of whom were highly regarded for their teaching styles, as well as their ability to be accommodating and supportive. Reviewers described Professor Harris’s lectures as more straightforward, while Professor Zenit’s lectures included more humor, visual aids, and demonstrations. Students felt that these lecture styles complemented each other well and remained well-coordinated throughout the semester. The only common suggestion, directed at both instructors, was to use clearer handwriting or type lecture notes.

Coursework consisted of eight problem sets, three midterm exams, four labs with lab reports, and textbook readings. Labs were completed in groups of four. Respondents agreed that this high-volume workload was very time-consuming but worthwhile. They stressed that office hours were helpful for gaining conceptual understanding and clarifying instructions both on homework and lab reports. The exams were considered reasonably difficult; a few class members expressed gratitude that the instructors had been willing to change the last exam from a three-hour final into a third in-class midterm.

Overall, students greatly enjoyed ENGN0810 despite its considerable difficulty. Many recommended the course to anyone who meets the prerequisites and is interested in physics.";810;60;10;1;1;0;0;0;0;3pm;Afternoon

Engineering concentrators should register for ENGN1930L.;"""Biomedical Engineering Design and Innovation"" (ENGN0930L) is a course geared towards students of all concentrations and disciplines; there is an equivalent course, ENGN1930L, geared towards engineering concentrators. The course discussed topics in biomedical design, and focused heavily on a teamwork-dependent structure. While there are no formal prerequisites for the course, students found a background in biology and medicine and design helpful.

The course was jointly taught between Professors Anubhav Tripathi and Celinda Kofron. Students praised them both for being effective instructors, although some felt that they could have organized the material of the course better and suggested that the practical design components be introduced earlier. Professor Tripathi and Kofron were noted to be available outside of class and willing to help.

Coursework consisted of both individual and team assignments, both of which contributed more or less equally to the final grade. Individual assignments included readings, quizzes, problem sets, a design notebook, and two ""deep dive"" papers. Team assignments were centered around the completion of the semester-long design project. Students felt that the coursework was not particularly difficult, but also not always relevant to engineering specifically.

Students found that the shadowing opportunities with clinical advisors and engineers was particularly useful for the course and set it apart from others. Suggestions for improving the course in the future included clearer expectations on the grading of assignments and changing the schedule of assignments to allow for the second half of the course to be more focused on the practical design components.

It explores many disciplines that relate to climate solutions, ranging from economics to physical and political science and beyond. While some students found it helpful to have some general background in biology and a general awareness of climate change issues, there are no official prerequisites for the course.

Being a small, discussion-based class, ENVS0465 was taught partially through video lectures from experts in each week’s topic. These were expected to be viewed before the weekly in-person lecture by Professor Stephen Porder. There was also a weekly Ask/Answer, in which each student would submit discussion questions they were curious about and respond to other students’ questions. Professor Porder would then structure the weekly lecture in response to these discussion posts. This “flipped” structure received mixed reviews from respondents. Students generally felt that Professor Porder was very good at promoting discussions, was thought-provoking, and was good at explaining complex issues in a straightforward and understandable way.

The majority of time outside of class was spent watching the weekly video lectures, which respondents noted could be quite time-consuming. Along with the video lectures and Ask/Answer posts, students had to complete supplementary readings. The final project, which constituted most of the grade for the course, was a 15-page policy brief accompanied by a six-minute video pitch to a group or person in power on how to reduce emissions. Students agreed that Professor Porder was always willing to help with the final project, even on short notice.

Overall, students felt like ENVS0465 was worth their time, one reviewer even describing it as “the best climate change course you can take at Brown.” The reviewer noted that on top of it being interesting, it did not approach climate change with pessimism, instead taking a solution-oriented approach that encouraged class members to understand and solve this climate change.";465;16;3;1;0;0;1;0;0;3pm;Afternoon

Environmental Studies;ENVS 1545;The Theory and Practice of Sustainable Investing;21st century businesses and investors face a broadening and deepening array of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) risks and opportunities. Climate change, water scarcity, community conflicts, resource depletion, supply chain breakdowns, worker well-being and economic inequality pose present material challenges that make sustainability an imperative for successful corporations and investors. We will examine current ESG strategy, trends, future scenarios, players, and frameworks and integrate that theory with practical investment performance analysis, metrics, and study of screens, asset classes, and diversification.;;1545;16;7;2;0;1;0;1;0;6:40pm;Evening
Environmental Studies;ENVS 1552;Science and Power: The Corruption of Environmental Health;The topics we focus on include: the use of human research subjects, the corporate use and corruption of science, health and development, and climate change’s impact on environmental health. What are the most effective ways to improve environmental health on the local, national, and/or global level? Developing a plan(s) to achieve improvements in environmental health is the main purpose of the course. Various reading, videos, and guest faculty will address this question, but the answer is not known. If the answer was known these problems (and this course) would not exist. Students will be expected to develop creative approaches to various solution(s) eg. Tiktok, TV show, plan for community organizing, legislation etc.;;1552;16;8;2;0;1;0;1;0;4pm;Afternoon
Environmental Studies;ENVS 1554;Farm Planet: Hunger, Development, and the Future of Food and Agriculture;Hunger amidst plenty is an enduringly wicked problem. Modern agriculture has become incredibly productive, fueling the global grain trade, the meatification of human diets, and the exponential expansion of food and non-food products. Still, the number of people who are hungry, food insecure, and/or malnourished is stable or increasing in various parts of the world. As global population rises, calls to further increase and intensify agricultural production ring out across the globe. Through (agro-)ecological, feminist, and justice lenses, we will explore the political economy of food insecurity and agriculture, the political ecology of agricultural development, and critical humanist approaches to the past, present, and future of farming. We will connect with human geographers, sociologists, anthropologists, historians, Indigenous scholars, Black Studies scholars, feminists, and people working outside of academia.;;1554;16;9;2;3;3;3;3;3;3;3
Environmental Studies;ENVS 1574;Climate Policy Research: Organizations and Obstruction;Over three decades, sufficient and equitable policies addressing the crisis of climate change have been elusive, and US leadership is crucial for an adequate global response. After several weeks of readings and lectures on climate policy, the course shifts to team-based research to produce strategic, policy-relevant briefings and scholarly outputs, some with partner organizations. Students will travel to D.C. for five days in October to attend meetings with experts and staff from government agencies, industry organizations, think tanks, journalists and environmental NGOs, and to hold briefings on our joint research.;;1574;16;10;2;1;0;0;0;0;3pm;Afternoon
Environmental Studies;ENVS 1615;Making Connections: The Environmental Policy Process;The diminishing quality of Earth’s systems and resources carries profound implications for the fulfillment of human rights and aspirations. But even as Western knowledge systems understand better the intrinsic interdependencies between humans and the non-human, policy gridlock persists. Indeed, scientific findings are regularly contested on political grounds. The purpose of this course is to learn how to apply diverse knowledges from Indigenous to Modern to map the relevant policy in problems at the intersection of human rights and environmental integrity, and to develop approaches to address them in ways that are creative, effective, responsible and just. Students are admitted in the following order: capstone fulfillment, core requirements, EEPS or ENVS concentrator, and others, in the order received in each category.;;1615;16;11;2;3;3;3;3;3;3;3
Environmental Studies;ENVS 1823;Climate Media, Discourse, and Power;How does the American public think about and talk about climate change, and how are these discussions shaped by the interventions of powerful interest groups and political elites? In this course, we will consider how individuals’ understandings of climate change are deeply shaped by relations of power, from corporate strategies to delay meaningful action on climate change, to the norms and operations of media institutions, to dominant environmentalist discourses that fail to engage larger socioeconomic structures. While we will primarily discuss how public understanding has historically been constrained by the operation of power, we consider throughout possibilities for crafting climate narratives that resist these limitations to pursue transformative change. This course will focus primarily on climate politics in the United States, but we will also consider other national contexts and impacts on communities across the globe.;;1823;16;12;3;3;3;3;3;3;3;3
Environmental Studies;ENVS 1825;Commodity Natures: Supply Chains From Extraction to Waste and Alternatives to Endless Growth;What goes into the things we use everyday? Who makes commodities and under what conditions? What happens to stuff after we throw it away? Are we stuck with mass consumption? Are there workable alternatives? These are the kinds of questions we will unpack. Reading from commodity and discard studies, and political economy and ecology, we will situate economic growth in social and environmental context. We will look at production, extraction, circulation, disposal, and afterlives of commodities, with particular attention to invisibilized labor and environmental externalities. And we will explore sustainability proposals, including circularity, degrowth, and repair. In addition to an individual paper, you will apply analytical tools in a semester-long research project to examine a commodity of your choosing. With peers, you will produce a report, narrative website, video, or web-series to narrate the life and afterlife of your thing.;;1825;16;13;3;0;1;0;1;0;2:30pm;Afternoon
Environmental Studies;ENVS 1905;Thinking with the Elements: Environmental Theories and Praxis;"Structured around critical “elements” in the contemporary relationship between people and the environments they inhabit—from water and carbon to forests and phosphorus—this course offers a tour through debates and conversations about environmental politics, knowledge production, and action. Through readings in decolonial, Black and Indigenous theory; fiction; films; and visits from scholars and practitioners, the goal of the class is to offer students fresh methods for understanding the origins of environmental inequalities based on racial, gendered and other forms of hierarchical thinking; how communities have and are living otherwise; and ways to imagine the kinds of social and ecological worlds we hope to build. Individual and group writing and other creative work are integral to this senior capstone course.";;1905;16;14;3;1;0;0;0;0;3pm;Afternoon
Environmental Studies;ENVS 1911;Narrating the Anthropocene;Narratives are key to how we understand our world—making nonfiction storytelling a critical part of comprehending and acting in a time of environmental crises. Through regular writing practice and discussions of readings and other media—including podcasts and film—this class will examine models for how nonfiction narratives can foster a better understanding of past and present environmental change, imagine an environmentally just future, explain technical information for a broad audience, and support an informed, politically active citizenry. Visits from authors and creators will supplement class discussion, as assignments build toward each student completing an environmentally-focused creative narrative project.;;1911;16;15;3;0;1;0;1;0;4pm;Afternoon
Environmental Studies;ENVS 1926;Wasted: Rethinking Chemical Environments;This senior seminar investigates chemical and other forms of industrially produced waste and its impacts on environment and society. We will take an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on scholarship from anthropology, geography, history, sociology, science studies, and discard studies. We will follow chemicals around the world, from their inception in Western laboratories to their disposal in landfills and waste pits of the global South. Along the way, we will consider how corporations engineer chemicals’ manufacture, governments regulate their use, sciences measure their human and ecological effects, and communities contend with the lived realities of chemical exposure and toxic suffering.;;1926;16;16;3;3;3;3;3;3;3;3
Ethnic Studies;ETHN 1000;Introduction to American/Ethnic Studies;Considers the U.S. as a society whose unifying identity is rooted in ethnic and racial diversity. Explores the historical and contemporary experiences of racial and ethnic groups in this country and analyzes different forms of representation of those experiences, as well as representations of the racial and ethnic stratification in the U.S. imagination.;;1000;6;1;1;1;0;1;0;1;1pm;Afternoon
Ethnic Studies;ETHN 1200K;Introduction to American Indian Studies;This class examines the politics, cultures, histories, representations, and study of the Native peoples of North America, with a primary focus on the United States. Although broad in cultural and geographic scope, the course does not attempt to summarize the diverse cultures of the several hundred Native groups of the continent. Instead, we will focus on several key issues in the lives of, and scholarship about, American Indian/Native American/First Nations/Indigenous peoples in the US. The course will consist of lecture on Monday and Wednesday, and once a week section meetings for discussion.;;1200;6;2;1;0;1;0;1;0;1pm;Afternoon
Ethnic Studies;ETHN 1612E;Black Archival Experiments;This course examines the political and cultural significance of the archival turn in Black Studies. Considering the fraught nature of historical documents that narrate the history of the United States, Black Studies scholars and creatives have developed experimental and interdisciplinary methodologies to remember and archive the stories, histories, and narratives of Black communities. In this class, we will engage two key questions: How do Black scholars and artists use and imagine the archives to tell alternative stories of Black life? What is the relationship between speculation and archival practice in Black culture? Students will engage the work of scholars and artists such as Saidiya Hartman, Tina Campt, Christina Sharpe, Alexis Pauline Gumbs, Fred Moten, Hortense Spillers, Octavia Butler, among many others. Alongside course materials, students will also experiment and engage with the Black Feminist Theory Collections at the John Hay Library.;;1612;6;3;2;3;3;3;3;3;3;3
Ethnic Studies;ETHN 1750D;Transpacific Asian American Studies;This is an advanced undergraduate seminar that is also open to American Studies and other graduate students for graduate credit. It is designed to help us think about the Pacific as a historical space where the Asian American formation is constructed, as goods, people and ideas circulate across the Pacific. We will explore ways which these historical circuits and exchanges have shaped questions of identity and belonging, taking China and the Americas as our principal points of connection. We will read across a number of fields, including: Asian Studies, American Studies, Asian American Studies, Latin American and Caribbean Studies.;;1750;6;4;2;1;0;1;0;0;8:30am;Morning
Ethnic Studies;ETHN 1750X;Native American Language Loss, Revitalization, and Resiliency;This class examines the issues of Native languages, primarily in the United States. The course will study the variety of languages in North America, the factors that have negatively affected the strength and use of native languages in many tribes, the impact of such loss on communities, and the ways in which those communities have worked hard to maintain, revitalize, or reclaim their languages.;;1750;6;5;3;3;3;3;3;3;3;3
Ethnic Studies;ETHN 1750Y;Native Pacific Islander Movements for Decolonization;What does a decolonized present and future for the Indigenous peoples of Oceania entail? Relatedly, what strategies and approaches have Native Pacific peoples utilized in advocating for Indigenous sovereignty and self-determination? In what ways has this work centered Native Pacific epistemologies and world views and how does taking these knowledges into account allow for the contestation of colonial narratives of Oceania and its peoples? Focusing on Native Pacific peoples' efforts to promote political status referendums, language education, food sovereignty, and cultural preservation as well as activism contesting the ongoing effects of nuclear imperialism, militarism, and settler colonialism, this seminar provides an overview of historical and contemporary movements for decolonization in the region. Students will also be invited to contribute to a collaborative digital humanities project which will serve as a resource for K-12 educators, scholars, and activists interested in these topics.;;1750;6;6;3;1;0;0;0;0;3pm;Afternoon
French ;FREN 0100;Basic French;This is the first half of a two-semester course. Four meetings a week for oral practice. One hour of work outside of class is expected every day (grammar/writing, oral practice, reading). Enrollment limited to 15.;;100;16;1;1;3;3;3;3;3;3;3
French ;FREN 0300;Intermediate French I;A semi-intensive elementary review with emphasis on all four skills (listening, speaking, reading and writing). Class activities include drills, small group activities, and skits. Class materials include videos, a French film, short stories, and various other authentic documents. Prerequisite: FREN 0200 or placement (Previous experience with French is required to take this class). Four meetings per week, plus a 50-minute conversation section with TAs.;"In FREN0300, ""Intermediate French,"" students continued learning all aspects of French at the intermediate level. The listed prerequisite is FREN0200 or the equivalent, which can come from an AP score or an adequate score on the placement exam. Many respondents indicated that they took French classes in high school before enrolling in this course.

Students praised the instructor, Clint Bruce, for being engaging, friendly, and energetic. Reviewers were especially happy that Bruce told them tactfully when their grammar was flawed: students appreciated this feedback and felt that they benefited greatly from it. Respondents were also very pleased that their instructor was available during office hours and through email, although they were less pleased about their section leader's availability. Some wished that Bruce had simply called on people instead of waiting for volunteers during class; others wished that there had been more mandatory in-class oral presentations and group work to give students more outlets for practicing their speaking skills.

As with most language courses, homework was assigned daily. In addition, there were five tests and two compositions. Students felt that these were useful and made up a course load about as difficult as they had expected. Several respondents wished, however, that they had more opportunities for them to be critiqued on their speaking and writing. In addition, reviewers would have liked to have been given clearer expectations on how the tests were going to be graded, as they were evaluated more harshly than they had expected.

For those with some background in French and motivation to prepare outside of class, FREN0300 will advance grammatical and expressive ability.";300;16;2;1;1;0;1;0;1;12pm;Afternoon
French ;FREN 0400;Intermediate French II;Continuation of FREN 0300 but may be taken separately. A four-skill language course that stresses oral interaction in class (three meetings per week plus one 50-minute conversation section). Materials include audio activities, film, and a novel. Short compositions with systematic grammar practice. Prerequisite: FREN 0300, FREN 0200 with permission, or placement.;N/A;400;16;3;1;1;0;1;0;1;12pm;Afternoon
French ;FREN 0500;Writing and Speaking French I;A four-skill language course that stresses oral interaction in class. Thematic units will focus on songs, poems, a short novel, a graphic novel, films and a longer novel. Activities include a creative project using Comic Life, and a systematic grammar review. Prerequisite: FREN 0400, FREN 0200 with written permission, or placement.;"“Writing and Speaking French I” stresses the importance of effective oral communication in French, while also improving reading and writing skills at an upper intermediate level. The course delves into the nuances of grammar, especially in social contexts, and aims to increase student vocabularies as well. Fluency is the ultimate goal, and French culture and media is frequently employed in the course as a means of achieving it. ""Intermediate French II"" or the equivalent level of proficiency and comfort in the language is a prerequisite for enrollment.

Florian Gargaillo was described as an absolutely excellent instructor: he was active, effective, and encouraging. Students loved the comfortable, friendly environment that the professor created in class, and felt his skill in engaging lively discussions kept them interested. One respondent found that the “class felt like chatting in French with friends,” and all appreciated the ease in participating, as it helped with language practice. Students found Florian not only well-versed in the material, but also approachable in office hours, and appreciated his high-quality and prompt feedback.

Assigned readings for the course varied. Students agreed that all were at the appropriate level of difficulty for their proficiency, but found that some books were better and more relevant than others. In terms of the movies required for the course, many students would have preferred French subtitles over English. Assignments for the course included four to five exams, four to five papers, two oral exams, and a project. Reviewers agreed that this was a lot of work, but it was worth it, and necessary to be constantly working in the language in order to learn.

Students generally spent about five hours a week outside of the classroom on this course, and agreed that it was useful. The course comes highly recommended as a way to continue learning French and in an engaging environment. Though students caution that you will need to devote a lot of time to homework and really practice grammar, many also cautioned, “Get ready to have fun!” and suggested that with an interest in the language, it is definitely a course worth taking.";500;16;4;1;0;0;0;0;1;3pm;Afternoon
French ;FREN 0600;Writing and Speaking French II;Prerequisite for study in French-speaking countries. Class time is devoted mainly to conversation and discussion practice. Writing instruction and assignments focus on essays, commentaries, and to a lesser degree, on story writing. Apart from reading assignments for discussion (press articles and literary excerpts), students select two novels to read. Prerequisite: FREN 0500 or placement. Enrollment limited to 15.;"Writing and Speaking French II” (FREN0600) helps students improve their French skills through practice with discussion, writing creatively and factually, and reading. The course is a prerequisite for students considering studying abroad in French-speaking countries, according to its description. In order to take the class, students must place into it through either the satisfaction of the “Writing and Speaking French I” (FREN0500) prerequisite or other means, such as taking a placement test or earning AP credit.

Dr. Stéphanie Ravillon, lecturer in French Studies, taught this section of FREN0600, and respondents had high praise for her instruction. She was said to deliver interesting lectures and supplement them with small group work. Reviewers described Professor Ravillon as encouraging, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable. A number of students appreciated her prompt responses to emails, and thought she was quite available outside of class, holding frequent office hours. Some respondents remarked favorably upon the quality of her feedback.

FREN0600 had a variety of assignments during the semester. Class members were required to read two books of their choosing and one play, in addition to completing weekly shorter reading assignments. They had two oral exams, one for each of the novels they read. There were five short essay assignments over the course of the semester: two in-class essays, and three out-of-class essays. In addition, students wrote five journal entries and completed grammar and vocabulary exercises. On the whole, respondents found the assignments appropriately difficult, and thought they corresponded nicely with the course objectives.

Overall, reviewers had a positive experience in FREN0600, in large part, it seemed, because of the quality of the instruction. As one student wrote, “Stéphanie is incredibly enthusiastic and an all-round fantastic teacher!” A couple class members suggested incorporating more literature into the curriculum, but others wrote that no improvements to the course were necessary. FREN0600 provides a good opportunity to improve one’s French, and class members suggested those interested shop multiple sections of the course and possibly alternate levels, such as FREN0500.";600;16;5;1;1;0;1;0;1;1pm;Afternoon
French ;FREN 0720I;J'accuse! La littérature et le cinéma face au réel;In this course we will study works from modern French and Francophone literature and cinema that make society their subject—to investigate, document, critique and/or protest. Taking our cue from the sharp portraits Baudelaire’s prose poems and Maupassant’s short stories offer of the social contradictions and inequities of 19th century France, we will then consider a range of 20th century texts and films—by Césaire, de Beauvoir, Ionesco, Sarraute, Salvayre, Bon, Diome, Kaplan, Sinha, Sebbar, Cantet, Sissako, Dardenne, Quintane—that narrate and denounce our unequal, neoliberal, violent world.

French ;FREN 1020A;Histoire de la langue française: usages, politiques et enjeux du français;A study of the evolution of the French language from the Middle Ages to the present. We will trace the main periods of this linguistic, social, historical and political development. Among topics to be explored: France’s encounter with English from the Norman conquest to the current so-called English “invasion,” the French Revolution’s destruction of dialects (patois), and the status of French in France’s former colonial empire. Through a variety of French and francophone texts we will investigate the transformations brought about by Feminists and by youth from the banlieues and examine the status of French outside of France. In French. Prerequisite: a course at the 600- or 700-level or equivalent proficiency.

French ;FREN 1330A;Fairy Tales and Culture;Fairy tales, which occur in almost every culture, encapsulate in (usually) succinct form many of the pressing concerns of human existence: family conflict, the struggle for survival, sexual desire, the quest for happiness, etc. This course explores why writers and readers have been attracted to the fairy-tale form through a study of its key elements and its uses in adult and children's literature, book illustration, and film. Special attention given to French contes de fées, along with North American, English, German, Italian and selected non-Western fairy tales. Discussions and readings in English with French, German, and Italian originals on reserve.;;1330;16;10;2;1;0;1;0;1;10am;Morning
French ;FREN 1710K;Frantz Fanon: Critical Theory and Decolonizing Practices between the Caribbean and (North) Africa;Frantz Fanon is one of the most prominent thinkers of anti-colonialism. A shared reference for both postcolonial and decolonial Scholars as well as for Black radical thought, many dimensions of his multidimensional and multidisciplinary work remain unknown to the American audience. By focusing on the Fanonian moment as a work of revolutionary theory and practice, this seminar offers a close-reading approach to his texts. It also analyzes the very diverse sources of Fanon’s works (from Césaire to Lacan) as well as the historical movements from which it drew its inspiration (the Algerian war of liberation). While reading Fanon in the historical context of the French Empire and the “francophone world”, the seminar also addresses his multiple and sometimes contradictory legacies and thus wishes to open a space for new creative and critical readings of the Fanonian text. Taught in English.;;1710;16;11;2;0;0;1;0;0;3pm;Afternoon
French ;FREN 2150E;Theories et fictions des Lumieres;This course seeks to examine the idea of “Lumières” in Eighteenth-century France through the reading of some of the major authors of the period. Focusing on the relationship between theory and fiction we will analyze the concepts central to the French Enlightenment: happiness, progress and freedom as they are formulated both in fiction (novels and plays) and in theoretical texts. Readings will include major texts by Montesquieu, Voltaire, Diderot, Rousseau, as well as other writers and philosophes. Conducted in French. Prerequisite: a course at the 0600- or 0700 -level or equivalent proficiency.

French ;FREN 2190A;Animals and I: Literature, Philosophy and the Question of the Animal;French philosophy–-most notably Deleuze and Guattari’s “becoming-animal” and Derrida’s “the animal that therefore I am”–-has importantly shaped thinking on the animal in the contemporary humanities. In this course we will read (mostly) French texts critical to the field of animal studies, focusing our reflection on the live problematic continually tethering and opposing the animal to the “I”—that is, to the question of the subject, of autobiography, of identity, of thought, of home. Readings include Deleuze and Guattari, de Fontenay, Levinas, Heidegger, Derrida, Despret, Bailly, Martin, as well as key literary texts (Michaux, Kafka, Ponge, Redonnet, Simon, Coetzee, Chevillard). Texts read in translation and course taught in English. Graduate students from a diversity of fields are welcome.;;2190;16;13;3;0;0;0;0;1;3pm;Afternoon
French ;FREN 2620M;Histoire globale du 19e siècle : Une étude comparative de l’Empire français et des autres Empires;Anglophone postcolonial theory has tended to marginalize or silence the history of the French Empire, focusing rather on the British Empire and the colonization of India. Decolonial perspectives have in turn privileged 1492 and the colonization of the Americas as the key date for thinking the history of modernity. This seminar will consider the theoretical limits of both these perspectives by foregrounding the archives of the French Empire from the end of the 18th century through the long 19th. The objective is to offer a synoptic vision of French imperialism through this period, articulating an overview (drawing from generalist accounts) with a more detailed analysis of primary sources (literature, writings by public intellectuals, philosophical writings) and of French-language archives (paying particular attention to such authors as the Saint-Simonians). Taught in French. Advanced undergraduates welcome, with instructor permission.;;2620;16;14;3;0;1;0;0;0;1pm;Afternoon

Gender and Sexuality Studies;GNSS 0092;Reading Reproductive (In)justice;How might the representation of reproductive injustices in literature, visual art, and film inform our conceptions of and fight for reproductive justice? In this discussion-driven first-year seminar, we will consider artistic renderings of reproductive injustices from the nineteenth century to the present, alongside theories of gender and sexuality. In taking up the Black feminist framework of reproductive justice, we will attend to violations of not only the right to be a parent and the right not to be a parent, but also the right to parent in a supportive and safe environment. Through this work, we will better understand the debates over reproductive freedom, especially in relation to difference, and engage in the work of theorizing reproductive justice for ourselves. Texts include Toni Morrison’s Beloved, Annie Ernaux’s Happening, Thomas Hardy’s Tess of the D’Urbervilles, and Alice Diop’s Saint Omer.;N/A;92;6;1;1;0;1;0;1;0;9am;Morning
Gender and Sexuality Studies;GNSS 0630;Is This Working? Doing as Value;This interdisciplinary course will consider the ways race, gender, ableism, transnational exchange, slavery, technology, immigration, environmental degradation, and the carceral state are implicated in the ways work is divided, practiced, and compensated. We will explore the ways productivity, citizenship, and respectability constellate around the idealized 40+-hour work week and the ways some bodies are used up and rendered debilitated by labor. Why are laziness, unproductivity, and dependence considered moral failings, and how do we define these traits? In the context of nearly two years of living with a pandemic, crushing student debt, rising inflation, and the monetization of everything, this course will toggle between questions of value and values, remuneration and fulfillment, exploitation and satisfaction. We will study a variety of written genres by authors such as DuBois, Graeber, Hochschild, Marx, Melville, Moshfegh, and Weeks.;N/A;630;6;2;1;0;1;0;1;0;2:30pm;Afternoon
Gender and Sexuality Studies;GNSS 0710B;Queer Comics;Although comics have always been a little queer (Batman and Robin anyone?), not all superheroes wear capes. This class brings together queer studies, 20th century history, literary criticism, media, and comics studies to explore the cultural significance of queer comics as a form of activism from the late 1950s to the present day. Since comics often fail to stay within the confines of just one medium, will look at the ways in which comics have crossed over to film, musicals, and fashion. Our focus in this class will be mostly on the United States, but we will also consider the rich transnational culture of queer comics. You will have the opportunity to focus on specific topics of interest to you within queer comics in two short essays (3-4 pages) and a final essay (8-12 pages) or creative project.;N/A;710;6;3;2;0;1;0;1;0;10:30am;Morning
Gender and Sexuality Studies;GNSS 1711;Speech and Silence, Trust, Rage and Fear: An Inquiry into the Possibility of Intimacy;Seminar examines intimate relationships: problems that arise from failures of couples to speak to each other, when instead of silence, they fail to speak openly, honestly, from a position of equality -particularly about their feelings, needs and desires. We examine the moral agency of men and women as it is reflected in what couples do, say and think. We look at whether relationships fail when men or women consciously or unconsciously choose women who fall into oppressive, subordinate postures and examine whether men take advantage of these postures.

Gender and Sexuality Studies;GNSS 2010Q;Pembroke Research Seminar: De-Colonial Retro-Speculation;"This seminar looks back and forward to the liberationist movements, practices, art works, and theories of the recent past (1960 to 2000) by queer, feminist, and/or global majority scholars, artists, political figures, and practitioners so as to offer new modes of understanding, and intervening into, our tumultuous present. While not imposing a progressive timeline, this seminar hopes to think through how such retro-speculation may help us understand our lives under the last half century of global neoliberal domination, including U.S. interventions in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, post-Cold War labor regulation, predatory global trade policies, and the valorization of human capital, developmentalism, and entrepreneurialism. Work we will consider includes, but is not limited to: women of color feminisms; Global South labor and justice movements; decolonial and anti-colonial theories; global gay, lesbian, and queer/trans movements; and abolitionist creative methodologies.";;2010;6;6;3;0;0;1;0;0;10am;Morning

This course focuses on translation and comprehension of Classical Greek prose. The goal is to expand your vocabulary, increase your ease with morphology, and deepen your understanding of syntax as each of these elements of the language interact with each other. The primary text will be Plato’s Apology, with some additional readings by Xenophon.;"“Introduction to Greek Literature” (GREK0300) is an intensive reading class that has students delve into Classical Greek prose. This course emphasizes translation and comprehension in an effort to deepen one’s understanding of the language. The course uses Plato’s Symposium as the primary text. Official prerequisites to this course are GREK 0200, GREK 0110, or the equivalent. Most reviewers had taken the official prerequisites, though some say having intensive Greek language courses in high school prepared them for the material.

Professor Fennerty received mostly positive reviews about her preparedness and passionate teaching. Students noted that she was incredibly intelligent and very effective when the class worked on their translations. Some students remarked that she could be a bit disorganized and get off-topic, but overall, her instruction was impactful. All reviewers also expressed that she was easily available outside of class and provided good feedback.

The coursework for this class included one translation exercise per class, biweekly quizzes, two midterm exams, one final, and one final project and presentation. Each translation assignment ranged from 20-30 lines of text. Reviewers found that the material was moderately difficult, but they all noted that this was necessary to learn the language.

Many students found that the greatest takeaway of this class was having such a passionate professor. Reviewers were divided over the primary text, as some found reading the Symposium and its various philosophies a noteworthy experience, while others found that they greatly disliked the text but grew more skilled in Greek through studying it. One reviewer also suggested that the final presentation should be shortened from 20 minutes.

Recommended prerequisite: GRMN 0400.;"“Twentieth-Century German Culture” (GRMN0500F) offers students the opportunity to broadly explore a century of German culture via a variety of written and visual texts spanning “literature, journalism, film, and art.” Respondents noted that this was very different from previous German language courses they had taken at Brown as the focus was not exclusively on learning the language. Instead, students were asked to critically discuss complex works. Students were expected to have taken GRMN0400 or equivalent prior to taking the course. While many students noted this was sufficient preparation, others also found German heritage and/or time spent in Germany to be useful.

Reviewers found Professor Jonathon Fine to be an effective instructor who led an interesting and efficient course. He was clear on valuing learning and participation over standard testing and tried to ensure that every student had an enjoyable experience. Classes were often discussion-based which many students liked. One critique students had was that they wished more course time was devoted to covering culture and history. At times, respondents also felt that the vocabulary being taught was not the most practical or useful for everyday use.

Respondents felt that course assignments were intriguing and necessary to properly participate in class. These generally consisted of pre-class readings, biweekly reading responses, daily homework, weekly quizzes, and one or two projects that students could choose to complete individually or in a group. Respondents felt that the workload was reasonable and that it helped them get the most out of the course.

Overall, students enjoyed the GRMN0500F, with graduate student Jasmin Meier garnering particular praise for the invaluable assistance she offered throughout the semester.

German;GRMN 1320X;Weimar Culture: German Modernity and Its Discontents;The years of the Weimar Republic were the hothouse of German cultural modernity. In a situation of crisis, the time between the end of World War I and the rise to power of National Socialism sees the emergence of new media as radio and film, an ever-accelerating urban life, changing social & gender roles, political radicalisms, as well as different artistic avantgarde movements. Weimar literature breaks from tradition, developing innovative forms to represent this new culture. At the same time, a flourishing journalistic landscape brings about new modes of cultural critique, essayistic theories of modernity, and figures such as the flaneur who reads the modern cityscape. Following a brief introduction to the historical background, we will read two novels of the period, two plays, & a series of selected poems, accompanied by journalistic pieces & representative examples of contemporary literary criticism.;;1320;11;5;2;0;1;0;1;0;1pm;Afternoon

The precarious moment of finding more than one seeks in one's midst is among the key motifs of Grimms' ""Household Tales"" that we will trace, following the way they move writers of literature, psychoanalysis, and critical theory. Reading the Grimms among others, we will find: what was ""once upon a time"" is not finished, nor can these uncanny tales be domesticated.";;1440;11;6;2;1;0;1;0;1;2pm;Afternoon
German;GRMN 1441B;The Awful German Language;German (not unlike others) is a foreign language. As such, it embodies oddities and barbarisms, provoking both interest and fascination, trembling and fear, from “native“ speakers of other (foreign) languages. Yet, even for “native“ speakers of German the language is not simply a given, but (at times) a threat (and under threat), an infinite (historical) task, a political-linguistic phantasm, a projection screen, a love affair, a traumatic experience. The seminar will explore complaints and concerns, from inside as well as from outside the German language, by Tacitus, Kleist, Mark Twain, Hölderlin, Hebel, Kafka, Benjamin, Kurt M.

German;GRMN 2662P;Postcatastrophic Narratives: Memory and Postmemory in German Literature after 1945;German culture after 1945 is determined by a changing relation toward its past: the horrors of National Socialism. This past was repressed, then gradually recognized, until it emerged as an essential part of German identity & politics in the 1980s. Literature played a role as a counter-memory of what had been officially forgotten, adopting a radically modern aesthetics to engage with Adorno’s dictum that writing poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric. Literature attempts to represent the unrepresentable, developing a different poetics of memory and postmemory, in part with a political dimension that finds echoes in today’s postcolonial debates. After an introduction to the historical context & clarification of key concepts such as trauma, postmemory, & the politics of memory, we will discuss seminal texts by Paul Celan, W. G.

German;GRMN 2662Q;Literature and Philosophy: Case Studies of a Vexed Relationship;"Literature and philosophy, as formations of rhetoric and logic, have an ancient and enduring relationship that is vexed by the conceptual interpretability of literary language. Without conceptual interpretation, no literary text could ever be said to possess any meaning. But if the philosophical interpretation of a text were to succeed fully in its translation of aesthetic form into conceptual content, the act of philosophical interpretation would render the literary artwork superfluous, its supposed contents having been shown not to need its singular aesthetic form. This seminar will investigate how transformative practices of reading might engage with this irreducible tension by turning to a constellation of exemplary theoretical readings of literature: Heidegger on Hölderlin and Rilke; Benjamin on Brecht and Proust; Adorno on Goethe and Beckett; Blanchot on Kafka; Derrida on Shakespeare and Celan.

“Introduction to Architectural Design Studio” (HIAA0100) provides students with the basic tools and strategies of architectural design. Through the series of studio classes, Professor Yasmin Vobis teaches students about the form, function, and structure of built environments. While this course does not have any formal prerequisites, enrollment is limited to those in the Architectural Studies program. Students found that general artistic or drawing work in the past, including Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, or previous coursework such as “Modern Architecture” (HIAA0850), aided their performance in the course.

Students described Professor Vobis as very passionate and knowledgeable about the course material. Some reviewers found that Professor Vobis gave great critical and positive feedback, but graded assignments very subjectively, which some of them found frustrating. One student remarked that without Professor Vobis’ encouragement, working in the studio every class would be nearly impossible, and they would not have learned as much as they did.

Assignments for the course consisted of a few readings and a new project almost every week; one notable project was to create an architectural model of a house. Some students commented that while this course was a heavy time commitment, they found the learning experiences valuable. Additionally, they noted that “studio culture” and working in the same space as their peers benefited their learning greatly.

Students recommended the class to interested shoppers, citing how the course was a lot of effort but very rewarding. They noted that this course helped them grow academically and make connections with both their peers and Professor Vobis";100;17;5;1;0;0;1;0;0;9:20am;Morning

History of Art and Architecture;HIAA 1627;Material Histories of American Capitalism;Political upheavals of the last decade have re-centered capitalism as a social ill, at the root of our current climate crisis, racial and gendered inequality, and the alienating experience of work and life in the 21st century. But how did we get here? A historical approach to capitalism can help us better understand our current conditions. But this history is more than a timeline of events. This course will examine capitalism mainly in North America from 1750-1950 through three types of material culture: Landscapes/Architecture, Objects, and Infrastructure. We will examine concepts argued to be associated with “capitalism”: modernity, individualism, industrialization, waged work, enslavement, dispossession, consumerism, and patriarchy. Methodologically, we will examine these concepts through specific material histories tied to spatialized and object forms, such as factories, lumber, plantations, mines, railroads, teacups, or greenbacks.;;1627;17;11;2;0;1;0;1;0;4pm;Afternoon

History of Art and Architecture;HIAA 1875;Form and Formalism;"This seminar will examine formalisms across art and mathematics in order to chart an intellectual pre-history of the computer and our contemporary digital imaginary. We will investigate topics such as: conceptions of “form” in nineteenth-century theories of perception, collective psychology, and geometry; methods of abstraction in twentieth-century art history and mathematics; the emergence of cybernetics and artificial intelligence; and anxieties about historicity and agency that motivated thinkers across all fields. Central questions include: what is the relationship between computation and creativity? How are truth and beauty understood and valued in our respective fields? What in the history of formalisms made the computer—and computational imaginary—possible? Ultimately this course will inquire into an intellectual history in which the humanities have always been digital, and new ways of conceiving human experience and understanding were forged at the intersections of art history and math.";;1875;17;13;3;0;0;1;0;0;10am;Morning

In particular, the seminar considers the extent to which technics of transfer facilitated the movement of images across medium and time.;;2210;17;14;3;1;0;0;0;0;3pm;Afternoon
History of Art and Architecture;HIAA 2860G;Photography in Theory and Practice;"Photography’s advent in 1839 brought into the world two inventions: a practical, functional means of making images with a camera, and a suggestive idea. This idea took many overlapping forms—the concept of nature automatically reproducing itself, of a picture radically dissimilar from the hand-made art that preceded it, of an analogic trace of the real world. This graduate-level seminar will use selected readings and class discussion to interrogate the relationship of photography as it has been theorized with its actual deployment in society and the world. Issues like medium specificity, ontology, the ""index,” and cultural memory will be explored.";;2860;17;15;3;0;0;0;0;1;3pm;Afternoon

On average, most respondents spent about five hours a week on outside work for the class, although the amount of time varied greatly from person to person. Opinions on the difficulty of the coursework ran the gamut of “I thought I would have to work harder” to “way too many hours.” Don’t let this deter you, though; if you have the desire and the time to learn Spanish, “Basic Spanish” is the way to go.";100;16;1;1;1;0;1;0;0;9am;Morning

History;HIST 0150A;History of Capitalism;Capitalism didn't just spring from the brain of Adam Smith. Its logic is not encoded on human DNA, and its practices are not the inevitable outcome of supply and demand. So how did capitalism become the dominant economic system of the modern world? History can provide an answer by exploring the interaction of culture and politics, technology and enterprise, and opportunity and exploitation from the era of the Atlantic Slave Trade to the 2008 Financial Crisis. HIST 0150 courses introduce students to methods of historical analysis, interpretation, and argument. This class presumes no economics background, nor previous history courses.;"“History of Capitalism” (HIST0150A) is an introductory history course exploring the ways capitalism becoming the dominant economic system of modernity and how it interacts with politics, technology, and society.

However, a few respondents noted that, due to the broadness of capitalism, this course focused particularly on a European relationship with capitalism through a historical lens; so potential shoppers should be aware of this and not expect too much from a modern perspective. Still, students generally found the class to be an exciting course along with a good introduction to the topic of capitalism. As one student described it, “I think I learned the most in this course compared to any other course I've taken at Brown.”";150;47;1;1;1;0;1;0;1;1pm;Afternoon
History;HIST 0233;Colonial Latin America;Colonial Latin America, from Columbus's voyage in 1492 to Independence in the nineteenth century, was the creation of three peoples: Europeans, Native Americans, and Africans.

And while students are not expected to have crafting expertise, such knowledge (e.g., weaving, sewing, knitting, dyeing) is certainly welcome as we undertake experiential research into various fiber arts.;N/A;552;47;6;1;1;0;0;0;0;3pm;Afternoon
History;HIST 0558C;Latinx Social Movement History;This course examines the history of Latinx social movements and politics during the 20th century into the present moment. Students will learn how various Latinx groups have organized around issues of race, ethnicity, labor, class, immigration, sports, gender, sexuality, citizenship, reproductive rights, and education. We will explore how these groups have utilized social and political organizing to make demands for social justice and equality. By utilizing primary and secondary sources, students will explore major questions, theory, and research methods pertinent to the historical narratives of Latinx people. Students will closely examine the legacy of these social movements and their implications for present-day politics and organizing.;"“LatinX Social Movement History” (HIST0558C) is a historical survey of LatinX social movements and politics from the 20th century to the present, with a specific focus on the organization of various LatinX groups around race, ethnicity, labor, class, immigration, sports, gender, sexuality, citizenship, reproductive rights, and education. The course is friendly to students with no previous experience, but some students found experience with classes relating to Latin America or general history to be useful.

Professor Mark Ocegueda’s reviewers indicated that he helped make class more engaging by effectively encouraging class discussion and using a variety of materials, like movies. Professor Ocegueda was characterized by respondents as an effective presenter and very passionate, though some students found the class to be lecture-heavy and at times slow. Grading was described as fair and mostly timely, and Professor Ocegueda was noted as receptive to students’ needs and readily available for feedback.

Assignments included one paper, one take-home exam, and one group project. Also required were two to three readings and a discussion response every week, which respondents said were worthwhile and useful to the course. Students spent, on average, about four hours per week on classwork, with a maximum of about eight hours in a week.

Reviewers walked away from the course with a deep knowledge of many groups across the LatinX diaspora and different social movements. Most respondents were non-concentrators not taking the class to satisfy a requirement, and found the class engaging and worthwhile. Most recommended taking the class, calling it “very interesting and eye opening.”";558;47;7;1;1;0;0;0;0;3pm;Afternoon
History;HIST 0559A;Culture and U.S. Empire;How have U.S. policymakers obtained public consent for their foreign policies? What sorts of ideas expressed in U.S. popular culture and public discourse have helped convince enough Americans that their nation's foreign policies were wise and just? How have ideas expressed in American culture supported and critiqued U.S. empire from within? In this seminar, we will examine the relationship of American culture to the U.S. imperial project by looking at how cultural narratives about race, gender, sexuality, class mobility, and American exceptionalism have not only shaped Americans’ interactions with other peoples, but have also rationalized the spread of U.S. power.;N/A;559;47;8;1;0;0;0;0;1;3pm;Afternoon
History;HIST 0577B;The US-Mexico Border and Borderlands: A Bilingual English-Spanish Seminar;In this First Year seminar, we will examine the historical formation, contemporary reality and popular representation of the U.S.-Mexico border from bilingual (English-Spanish), multicultural (U.S., Mexican, Mexican-American, indigenous and Asian immigrant), and transnational perspectives within the framework of globalization, and pay particular attention to the movement of peoples—workers, families, women and children--in both directions.;N/A;577;47;9;1;0;0;1;0;0;3pm;Afternoon
History;HIST 0580M;The Age of Revolutions, 1760-1824;"In the middle of the eighteenth century, the Americas belonged to a handful of European monarchies; within a few decades, most of the Americas was composed of independent republics, some of the European monarchs were either deposed or quaking on their thrones. Usually considered separately, revolutions in British North America, France, Saint-Domingue (Haiti) and Spanish America had diverse local circumstances yet composed a single cycle of intellectual ferment, imperial reform, accelerating violence and, forging of new political communities. We will examine revolutions that helped create the world we live in. Enrollment limited to 19 first year students. P";"“The Age of Revolutions, 1760-1824” (HIST0580M) is a first-year seminar that explores the various 18th-century revolutions that shifted the Americas from being made up of European colonies to independent republics. The course considers the revolutions in British North America, France, Saint-Domingue, and Spanish America as part of a singular era of intellectualism, imperial reform, violence, and newly emerging politics. This course is writing-designated. Some respondents cited a background in American and European history as helpful for the course, but there are no official prerequisites.

Professor Jeremy Mumford was praised by respondents for being extremely accommodating, supportive, and compassionate. Respondents emphasized that he was always receptive to new ideas and willing to meet during office hours to talk through issues. The course was organized into two sections. The first section was lecture-based and covered the material explored in the readings. Though effective, some respondents felt this portion of the class was sometimes too concise. The second section of the class was discussion-based, and Professor Mumford was praised for his ability to facilitate student discussions.

The course was structured through four to six readings per week, which respondents said often amounted to over 100 pages of reading. There were also weekly online discussions about the readings due before class. The course assignments included several reading comprehension quizzes and one 10-15 page research paper at the end of the semester.

While respondents agreed that they learned a lot from this course, they warn prospective students that the class is very reading– and discussion–intensive and the work can sometimes feel tedious.";580;47;10;1;0;0;0;0;1;3pm;Afternoon
History;HIST 0623C;Americans in the USSR;This Sophomore Seminar will investigate the countless American journalists, diplomats, students, tourists, athletes, musicians, etc. who traveled to the Soviet Union. We will pay careful attention to their preconceptions, motivations, experiences, and reflections after the fact. Some went for work, others to explore an alternative to capitalism or to build socialism, and still others traveled to explore a society that claimed to have overcome discrimination based race and gender. At the end of the semester, students will work on final projects in which they delve more deeply into a specific aspect of the topic.;N/A;623;47;11;1;0;0;0;0;1;3pm;Afternoon
History;HIST 0682E;Lobsters, Thylacines, and Bacteria: An Introduction to Animal Histories;Amid a period of existential human angst about the future of our planet and the other creatures on it, the discipline of history is experiencing an “animal turn”. This developing interdisciplinary approach draws on numerous fields, from anthropology to veterinary science, to better understand the lived experiences of non-human animals in the near and distant past. Animals have not only played important roles in human history, as abstract symbols, exploited resources, or close partners, but they also have their own histories. Can we get at animal histories independent of human interference? In this discussion-based seminar we will explore a variety of research modes in the emerging field of animal histories and tackle the challenge of de-centering humanity in the study of the past.;N/A;682;47;12;1;0;1;0;0;0;4pm;Afternoon

History;HIST 1112;China's Early Modern Empires;“China’s Early Modern Empires” traces the development of empire in the China region from the rise of the Mongols in the twelfth century to the eve of China’s encounter with the West in the nineteenth century. The course focuses on the early modern empires of the Chinese Ming (1368-1644) and Manchu Qing (1644-1911), situating them in larger patterns of world history. We look at how conquest and the demands of empire-building shaped frontier relations and East Asian regional geopolitics, as well as social relations (ethnic and gender identities in particular), economic organization, government, and culture within the core Chinese portions of the empires. Emphasizing the dynamic character of the region’s history prior to the rise of modern Western imperialism, the course provides a solid foundation for the study of modern and contemporary China.;;1112;47;14;1;0;1;0;1;0;10:30am;Morning

This course introduces the history of Chinese societies from 1850, when a massive civil war destabilized the country and sent a new wave of migrants across the globe. We will explore how local and regional society was affected by the spread of new conceptions of the Chinese nation, new kinds of government, and cultural and technological innovations. Coursework addresses the construction of race, ethnicity, and religion as well as gender and sexuality; the effects of war and catastrophe; different formulations of revolution and self-strengthening; and more.";;1121;47;15;1;1;0;1;0;1;11am;Morning
History;HIST 1200C;History of Greece: From Alexander the Great to the Roman Conquest;In 334 BCE, the 22-year-old Alexander crossed over to Asia and North Africa, changing the history of the West forever. The invasion by a small, if intensely introspective, Greek peoples led to the spread of a monotheistic idea, belief in individualism, alienation from central power, and, conversely, the creation of natural law and human rights, and a deep desire for universalism. By its silences, the preserved narrative (constructed by European males) minimizes the lives of women, children, slaves, and those not of European origin. But largely because of Alexander’s conquests and the expansion of cosmopolitan thinking, the evidence embedded in Hellenistic history is far more diverse than for most other periods of classical history. This course focuses on inclusive social and intellectual history. Of particular emphasis will be the tension between the individual and the search for universal connection.

The course will include readings and discussions on the region’s ecological origins; the social history of its diverse Indigenous and immigrant populations, including African-descended peoples; exploration myths and European colonial projects; and more recent efforts to exploit and protect Amazonia’s extraordinary natural and human resources. The course will use tools and resources from archaeology, anthropology, biology, and social and cultural history, and will also examine popular representations of the Amazon through novels, newspapers, podcasts, and film.";;1360;47;17;2;1;0;1;0;1;2pm;Afternoon
History;HIST 1531;Movement Politics in Modern America;"This course explores the history of political movements in the United States from Reconstruction through Trumpism—politics from the bottom up, a history of “popular politics.” The course begins with emancipation and the rise of industrial capitalism in the late nineteenth century and the civil rights, populist, and reform politics that emerged in response. The course concludes the New Right and transformations in political culture from Reaganism to Trumpism. In between, we consider civil rights, progressivism, feminism(s), the New Deal coalition, anti-communism, Black freedom, the New Left, second wave feminism, and gay rights. Major themes include: conservatism and liberalism across the twentieth century; race, class, and gender in shaping the nation’s politics; the relationship between social movements and political power; the democratic promise and the limitations of political movements and of the U.S. political system more broadly.";;1531;47;18;2;1;0;1;0;0;8:30am;Morning
History;HIST 1573;Energy and Power: An Environmental History of North America;Where does power come from? This course uses the history of energy—the intertwined pasts of people and sources of fuel from wood, muscles, and corn to coal, oil, and nuclear reactions—to examine how power in political terms and power as a synonym for energy are related. Serving as an introductory environmental history of North America, the class also touches on other geographies. Lectures start before agriculture but focus on how human energy use has transformed environments and societies in the past 200 years. Key themes covered in the assigned readings, films and podcasts include: settler colonialism, capitalism, slavery, extractivism, climate change, biodiversity loss, environmental justice, and activism. Assignments include options for creative projects as well as formal research papers. No prerequisites.;;1573;47;19;2;0;1;0;1;0;2:30pm;Afternoon
History;HIST 1620;Resisting Empire: Gandhi and the Making of Modern South Asia;Gandhi's India tracks the emergence and transformations of British colonial rule in the Indian subcontinent, the insurgencies and the cultural and economic critiques that shaped anti-colonial nationalism, the conflicts that fueled religious differences and the ideas that shaped non-violent civil disobedience as a unique form of resistance. With readings from Gandhi, Marx and Tagore, amongst others, this course interrogates relationships between power and knowledge, histories from below, as well as violence and political mobilizations that would, by the mid-twentieth century, bring down an empire and create a bloody and enduring divide with the birth of two nation-states.;;1620;47;20;2;0;1;0;1;0;10:30am;Morning
History;HIST 1825F;Nature, Knowledge, Power in Early Modern Europe;This course examines the creation and circulation of scientific knowledge in Renaissance Europe, ca. 1450-1600. We will explore the practices, materials, and ideas not just of astronomers and natural philosophers, but also of healers, botanists, astrologers, alchemists, and artisans. How did social, political, economic, and artistic developments during this period reshape how naturalists proposed to learn about, collect, manipulate, and commercialize nature? We will also consider the ways in which colonial projects forced Europeans to engage with other “ways of knowing” and rethink classical knowledge systems. P;;1825;47;21;2;1;0;1;0;1;10am;Morning

History;HIST 1956A;Thinking Historically: A History of History Writing;Philosopher George Santayana famously warned that “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” Ten years later, industrialist Henry Ford perhaps even more famously dismissed that notion: “History is more or less bunk.” What we mean by history and how we construct and use it are essential questions in all societies. Thinking Historically explores how we view and employ the past. The course examines major ways of interpreting the past through a survey of historians and methods and studies how history is produced, used, and misused, by professionals as well as by the public.;;1956;47;24;2;0;1;0;1;0;4pm;Afternoon
History;HIST 1961D;Heaven Above, Suzhou and Hangzhou Below: Urban Culture in Early Modern China;The commercial boom of sixteenth and seventeenth century China stimulated the growth of a lively popular culture in the great cities of the southeast—Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou. These cities became magnets for ambitious scholars, pleasure-loving merchants, courtesans, artists, and writers and sites for the production of some of the great masterpieces of Chinese vernacular fiction, drama, book art, and painting. After some background reading in socioeconomic history, the course focuses on analysis of the literature and art of the period and what it reveals about the short-lived “floating world” of late imperial China.

History;HIST 1974D;River Histories: Fishes, Floods and the Transformation of Freshwater Ecosystems;As food sources and transportation routes, rivers have long played important roles in human societies, and people have in turn transformed them. While many histories explore the lives of people living along rivers, this course will move from the terrestrial realm into the aquatic realm to consider how fluvial ecosystems work, from the smallest microorganisms to large creatures like salmon and alligators. This will allow us to think about how rivers have changed over time as people blocked them with dams, built levees to stop them from flooding, or straightened them into shipping canals. The best documented members of fluvial ecosystems have usually been fish, so we will pay particular attention to histories of fishing. We will also discuss transportation, water power, flood mitigation, and fights between farmers, fishers, and industrialists over how rivers have been exploited.;;1974;47;30;2;0;0;0;0;1;3pm;Afternoon
History;HIST 1974E;The Intellectual History of Imperialism;What is an empire? What does an empire do? What is the difference between imperialism and colonialism? How have historical actors as well as historians between the seventeenth and twentieth centuries answered these questions? This seminar considers the long history of intellectual debate over imperialism and its relationship with state formation, capitalism, labor, subjecthood, and the environment. We will read proponents of imperial expansion, advocates of imperial reform, and fierce critics of imperialism. Readings will include canonical texts authored by major historical figures such as John Locke and Vladimir Lenin as well as pamphlets and legislative debates that document the everyday practice of imperialism. In engaging with such primary sources, we will consider how rival visions of imperialism shaped ideological traditions as diverse as liberalism, fascism, conservatism, and communism.;;1974;47;31;2;0;1;0;1;0;4pm;Afternoon

We will read documentary sources, feminist theory, and historical scholarship to ask who women were, what they were up against, and what they wanted. We will hold “women” as a contingent category that changed over time often in relation to categories such as race, reproduction, violence, protest, work, and queerness. And we will center major debates and keywords of contemporary feminist theory, including misogyny, gender essentialism in the era of trans*feminisms, the phrase “white feminism,” ugly and minor affects (including especially nostalgia, besiegedness, anxiety, and purity), institutionalization and the history of women’s studies, and the question of the canon.;;1976;12;5;2;1;0;0;0;0;12pm;Afternoon

Treating it as a sweeping aesthetic upheaval across an international horizon that tied together a range of different disciplines—literature, the visual arts, music, dance, and philosophy—we will study both its monuments and its margins, its languages and its gestures, against a backdrop of new forms of experience, education, and entertainment: museums, variety theaters, amusement parks, world’s fairs. We will also delve into recoveries or continuations of modernism by other means and to different ends, in recent exhibitions, performances, and rewritings.;;1976;12;7;2;0;1;0;1;0;10:30am;Morning

Humanities;HMAN 2401R;Capitalism and its Metamorphoses;"Not only has capitalism been defined in many different ways (as this or that); it also redefines itself endlessly. Is capitalism as metamorphosis the best definition of it? And if so, could we encapsulate capitalism in the conjunction or preposition “as,” which registers both the expression of equivalence (“as much as”) and the fiction of it (“as if,” “as though,” “as it were”). This collaborative humanities seminar will explore the metamorphic masks of capitalism through readings ranging from Marx (capitalism as vampirism) and Benjamin (capitalism as religion) to Sylvia Wynter (capitalism as plantation). We will approach literary genres such as “it-narratives” (where money narrates its own circulation) and reflect upon the fictionality of personhood (corporations acting as persons), as well as metaphors of mining (data) and extraction (energy) as shared logics of the ""capitalocene.""";;2401;12;10;3;0;0;1;0;0;3pm;Afternoon
Humanities;HMAN 2401S;Experimental Ethnography for the Masses;This course is a forward-thinking exploration of experimental ethnography, focusing on creative and multi-modal approaches and their relevance and application to humanistic social inquiry. Participants will consider both the lingering hierarchies and decolonial horizons of knowledge production and sharing, centering theory and practice from a range of disciplines within as well as outside of the academy. Geared to advanced undergraduate and early graduate students, learning takes place through modules and case study, supplemented by guest lectures, residencies, and other activities. The course also includes a series of lab sessions providing training in specific methods such as creative writing, drawing, photography, film, and performance, and culminates in a public sharing of participants’ collaborative and independent work.;;2401;12;11;3;0;1;0;1;0;1pm;Afternoon
Humanities;HMAN 2401T;Critique of Political Theology: Ancient Texts and Contemporary Questions;The seminar examines political theology through critical readings of ancient canonical texts considered as foundational in the traditions of Western philosophy, Judaism, and Christianity. Texts from Anaximander, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristotle, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, and the Renaissance musings of Etienne de La Boetie will be read alongside 20th-century thinkers—Carl Schmitt, Pierre Clastres, Cornelius Castoriadis, Hans Blumenberg, Michel Foucault, Regina Schwartz, Jan Assmann, Giorgio Agamben, Judith Butler, and Bonnie Honig. Can readings of ancient canons be both non-anachronistic and critical? Must critique be secular? Or Gnostic? Can the political be separated from the theological? What can formations of ancient theo-political imagination teach us about the limits of ours? The seminar is taught in parallel with Professor Stathis Gourgouris and his class at Columbia university. Collaborative work will take place among students at Brown and across the two campuses.;;2401;12;12;3;3;3;3;3;3;3;3

Prepares students to communicate in written and spoken language. Activities are conducted in Hindi/Urdu. Meets four hours weekly.;"“Intermediate Hindi-Urdu” (HNDI0300) is the first part of a year-long intermediate Hindi/Urdu course intended to improve students' proficiency in speaking, listening, reading, and writing in Hindi and Urdu for personal and professional needs. This course is also designed for students to learn about South Asian culture while learning the language. The prerequisite course is “Beginning Hindi or Urdu” (HNDI0200), and it was noted that speaking another Indo-Aryan language facilitated comprehension of these languages.

Professor Ashok Koul was commended on his enthusiastic, engaging, and efficient teaching style. He was passionate, friendly, and very accommodating to student needs and what they sought from the class, with one student remarking “I've learned a lot from him just from casual conversation.” Respondents found that Dr. Koul was always available for help, and both native Hindi and English speakers found his instruction in Urdu effective.

The coursework consisted of daily homework assignments, three written exams, one take-home exam, one oral exam, and one final project consisting of written and oral components. Students remarked that they enjoyed the read-alouds required in class. Participation also comprised a fifth of the course grade, for which some reviewers emphasized being prepared to speak in class, and also make mistakes. Some recommended that the homework should have had more focus on grammar. One student also sought more graded assignments and quizzes to keep students accountable for the material, as it was easy to forget some material due to a lack of regular practice assignments. Feedback on assignments was returned promptly and fairly.

HNDI0300 was highly recommended as a means to maintain conversational and cultural fluency for Hindi and Urdu, for both those concentrating and not concentrating in South Asian Studies. To those who are considering this course, even native speakers, students emphasized the importance of keeping up with the vocabulary and reviewing grammar. Another student remarked that learning Hindi and Urdu enhanced their own connections to the language.";300;3;2;2;1;1;1;1;1;1pm;Afternoon

International and Public Affairs;IAPA 0300;Costs of War;This interdisciplinary seminar explores a ground-level view of war and its human, economic, environmental, and social consequences. We primarily take up the example of the post-9/11 wars, focusing less on the causes of war, on battles, elite war strategies, or relations between states than on what war is like for those caught within it, what larger social and economic contexts make it more or less likely, what are its impacts for many differently situated peoples, and how myths about violence, and even the category of war itself, often obscures fuller understanding.;N/A;300;26;2;1;0;1;0;1;0;1pm;Afternoon
International and Public Affairs;IAPA 0400;Fiscal Plumbing 101: The American Tax State in Comparative and Historical Perspective;This IAPA Gateway course explores the origins and development of the American Tax State in comparative and historical perspective. It's designed as an interdisciplinary introduction to the welter of problems associated with the raising and spending of public revenue –the life blood of contemporary nation-states. It should be of use to students interested in the political and institutional development of the welfare state, and in the origins, fault lines and prospects of American federalism. We explore the origins and development of the American Tax State in comparative and historical perspective. It is designed as an interdisciplinary introduction to the welter of problems associated with the raising and spending of public revenue –the life blood of contemporary nation-states.;"*Please note that this course was taught online – this review may not be reflective of future semesters*

“Fiscal Plumbing 101: The American Tax State in Comparative and Historical Perspective” (IAPA0400) introduces the problems of the welfare state in terms of raising and spending public funds. The course explores the development of the U.S. tax state through a comparative and historical approach. There are no official prerequisites for this course as it is designed to be an IAPA gateway course, but some students found a basic understanding of the U.S. political landscape and political history helpful in navigating the material.

Many students described Professor Anthony Levitas as an effective lecturer who was very passionate about the material and receptive to students' needs. They praised the professor’s ability to simplify complex concepts and emphasized that he really cared about the students and worked to facilitate an environment where everyone could be engaged and learn productively. One student reported that at first this course was their most difficult class, but “it slowly grew into my favorite class due to the instructor’s dedication to helping me learn and grow.” Another respondent appreciated that Professor Levitas varied assignments between quizzes and papers to help students best review materials, and that he balanced class time between lectures and discussions well.

The coursework for this class consisted of two readings per lecture, three quizzes, three papers, and one take-home final exam. Many students found both the readings and materials very rewarding for the course. One reviewer suggested potential students keep up with the readings as the quizzes and paper prompts were directly related to them. Most reviewers said they worked an average of four hours per week outside of class, but some class members reported spending up to eight to ten hours per week.

Despite the course's fairly large time commitment, one student claimed the course “[is] likely the most worthwhile course you’ll take in college. Understanding how and why we pay taxes, and where that money goes is vitally important to being an informed citizen.”";400;26;3;1;0;1;0;1;0;1pm;Afternoon
International and Public Affairs;IAPA 1002;Foundations of Policy and Governance;An overview of policymaking and policy analysis in the contemporary United States. The course begins with an examination of traditional justifications for government action. We will then examine the discipline of policy analysis that has arisen to design and evaluate public policies. We will also consider critiques of the rational method and ask questions about how policy expertise fits into the political system. The course ends with classic works on organizations and implementation. Not open to graduate students.;;1002;26;4;1;3;3;3;3;3;3;3
International and Public Affairs;IAPA 1003;Foundations of Security;This course presents an interdisciplinary approach to the study of security. This means we examine the notion of what constitutes security from a variety of disciplinary perspectives that may not always agree or overlap. Specifically, in addition to political science, the course draws on recent work in evolutionary psychology, biological anthropology and behavioral economics to examine existing problems, issues and questions in security studies. The goal of this course is to investigate the extent to which various disciplinary models and methods can help to further inform or develop the study of security. Substantive applications include a wide variety of empirical methods.;;1003;26;5;1;0;1;0;1;0;10:30am;Morning

International and Public Affairs;IAPA 1201B;Victory, Defeat, and Everything In-Between: History, Strategy, and Politics;This is a course about strategy, politics, and history, their complicated relations, and the ways in which strategy talk has become a staple of politics. One goal is to give students a working knowledge of the fundamentals of strategic theory at multiple levels of analysis, ranging across the various instruments of military power. Another, more important goal of our seminar is to make students aware of strategic thought as tools with which to think as opposed to simply existing as historical artifacts. We are not intellectual antiquarians. Each week we will challenge students to make clear connections between theorists, history, and contemporary politics. If students leave the course with only one idea, it should be that that there is no such thing as a military strategy separable from achieving political objectives.;;1201;26;7;1;0;1;0;1;0;4pm;Afternoon
International and Public Affairs;IAPA 1201D;Social Entrepreneurship;Social Entrepreneurship, engages students in the process of exploring significant global problems and developing innovative solutions that drive transformative social change. The course helps students understand the strategies that social entrepreneurs employ to tackle complex and entrenched social problems with transformative approaches that work and impact systems. Students will learn about real organizations and interact with entrepreneurs leading this work. Case studies, complemented by articles and guest speakers, will show different approaches to social entrepreneurship and illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of various models and strategies.;;1201;26;8;1;3;3;3;3;3;3;3
International and Public Affairs;IAPA 1201F;Gender and Sexuality in the Middle East;The aim of this course is to offer an overview of the key issues in the study of gender and sexuality in the Middle East. It will provide a gendered understanding of prevailing structures, ideologies, social practices and trends for those students interested in Middle East societies, cultures and politics, as well as those interested in women and gender studies.

Topics include: the historical legacy, why Latin America fell behind, import substitution industrialization, the debt crisis, poverty and income inequality, inflation, trade and financial liberalization and competitiveness. The class exposes students to a number of concepts and tools that can be broadly applied to the understanding of development in other geographic areas.;;1401;26;10;2;1;0;1;0;0;8:30am;Morning
International and Public Affairs;IAPA 1500A;Ethnographic Research Methods;This course introduces students to ethnographic research methods as a capacious set of tools for understanding the diverse ways people make sense of social issues that affect their lives and shape their experiences. It also addresses the ethical, legal, and political dilemmas that ethnographers encounter while engaging in field research. The course consists of weekly lectures, fieldwork practice, and ethnographic lab sessions. Students learn how ethnographers design their research projects, undertake participant observation in their chosen field sites (including online), write fieldnotes, prepare for and conduct interviews, collect and analyze artifacts, use visual and audio tools to experiment with multimodality, and work with archives, both historic and contemporary. Throughout the course, students will practice and apply these methods to pursue independent research projects on a topic of their choice.

International and Public Affairs;IAPA 1700P;Displaced: How Global Systems Shape Refugee Families;This course approaches the global refugee crisis from a sociological vantage point. Who is considered a refugee? How is this category constructed? We examine how the state and other global systems categorize and constrain refugee families across borders. The family is a key institution—in society as well as in migration. We investigate how displacement shapes key dynamics of family life, such as family roles and identities, social relationships and networks, and economic strategies and status. We will follow the experiences of refugee families and the institutions that shape their trajectories—from their lives in limbo displacement (often in the Global South) to the possibility of more durable solutions, including repatriation to their home country, local integration, or resettlement in the Global North.

International and Public Affairs;IAPA 1700R;Inequality, Policy, and Economics;Tax the rich? Increase public housing? Invent a new vaccine? This course examines inequality in United States by using the tools of economic research to ask: who benefits from different policy choices? And at what cost? Week-by-week, we will dive into different domains such as education, housing, health, innovation, wealth, and taxation. To prepare for each class, students will be asked to read a published economics research paper in depth. We will use this paper as jumping off point to explore the broader domain and hone our understanding of research design and quantitative methods. This seminar is designed to help students build skills and generate ideas for a future senior thesis or capstone project. The semester will culminate in students writing a proposal for an independent research project. (IAPA Jr Seminar);;1700;26;13;2;1;0;0;0;0;3pm;Afternoon
International and Public Affairs;IAPA 1700S;Survey of Time: Temporality, Social Theory, and Difference;Time. The lifeblood for everything we do in this life and potentially the next. It is the distance between you and I. It is the only thing we all have and can never regain. In our very finite lives, we are constantly working against the clock in an attempt to find meaning, love, and purpose. Our daily lives are calculated by the clock, calendars, and other measures of time blocks. Our mental processes (memory, consciousness, etc.) are steeped in temporal terms as we consolidate our present on the basis of our pasts and potential futures. Time is everything – the only thing. The goal of this course is to expose you to the funky concept of time and how it orders and informs our daily lives. (IAPA Jr Seminar);;1700;26;14;2;1;0;0;0;0;3pm;Afternoon
International and Public Affairs;IAPA 1701M;Justice, Gender, and Markets;How do poor women connect to markets? How have philosophical ideas about gender influenced ideas about gender and justice and consequently, gender, justice and markets? Answering these questions helps us explore how justice, gender, and markets interact and the conditions that keep millions of women trapped in poverty. They help us understand the history of entrepreneurship by women and the role entrepreneurship plays in empowering women. Such an understanding, is of course, a critical step to help us develop policies and programs that support women seeking to escape entrenched poverty.;;1701;26;15;2;0;1;0;1;0;4pm;Afternoon
International and Public Affairs;IAPA 1701N;Diplomacy, an Art That Isn't Lost;"This seminar is offered in Washington DC to Brown in Washington students and remotely to students on campus. It examines the practice and profession of diplomacy and its relationship to the policy process. While the practice of diplomacy and the policy-making process has a U.S. focus, the lessons learned apply to other nation states as well. We briefly review the history of inter-state relations, including the international legal basis for diplomatic relations. Diplomacy has evolved over the years and has been greatly influenced by modern technology; however, it continues to incorporate such common functions as policy formulation, representation, reporting, negotiation, intercultural contacts and interaction with the media, parliamentary bodies and other external actors. The course will provide a knowledge base for understanding the policy process and will expose students to policy analysis, memo writing for decisionmaking, negotiations and verbal communications.";;1701;26;16;2;0;0;1;0;0;3pm;Afternoon
International and Public Affairs;IAPA 1701V;Democratization;This course examines why autocratic states democratize and why democracy breaks down in already democratic states. The course analyzes domestic factors (e.g., values, norms, religion, culture, economic development and inequality, natural resources, protests, insurgencies, and coups d’etat,), as well as international ones (e.g., trade, foreign aid, international organizations, and international war). The course also examines the reasons for and the effectiveness of different ways that governments resist democratization, including accommodation, censorship, and repression.;;1701;26;17;2;0;0;1;0;0;3pm;Afternoon
International and Public Affairs;IAPA 1701W;The Cold War in Latin America;This seminar aims to enrich understanding of the present by studying the recent past. Many countries in Latin America still bear scars from past interventions, so we will assess the long-term impact they had. Poverty, repression, gang violence, mass migration and other problems that Americans see south of our border were caused by various factors, but they cannot be understood without considering the continuing impact of Cold War interventions. We will consider the ways Latin American countries have sought to recover from the trauma of these interventions, including the emergence of museums and other institutions that aim to preserve historical memory.;;1701;26;18;2;1;0;0;0;0;3pm;Afternoon
International and Public Affairs;IAPA 1701X;American Education Policy in Historical and Comparative Perspective;"This seminar examines the historical roots of select but fundamental issues in the finance, regulation, and governance of public education. Focus is on the American expression of these issues and debates, but we will look to the experience of other multilevel democracies to highlight conceptual and institutional differences that are of theoretical interest and perhaps of practical use. The seminar will explore: how the goals of education as a public good get defined; history of school finance and governance in America, including our often court-ordered efforts to make this financing more ‘equitable’; ways in which ‘school choice’ has intersected in practice and in theory with segregation, integration, and debates over mechanisms to improve school quality; problems caused by using student test results to hold teachers and schools accountable for performance; and the role of teacher training systems in educational improvement.";;1701;26;19;3;0;0;1;0;0;3pm;Afternoon
International and Public Affairs;IAPA 1701Y;Climate Change, Power, & Money;"Fossil fuel energy made economic development possible, but now we’re cooking the planet. Some want to keep burning carbon; some want to halt capitalism itself; most are somewhere in between. This course is about the political economy of decarbonization. It begins by evaluating the state of affairs, how we became dependent on carbon, the current stakes, and the key actors and stakeholders. It then goes straight to debate the core problem of our future: What are the trade-offs that come with different decarbonization paths? The course then examines some of the most prominent solutions and challenges for rapid decarbonization. Throughout the course, we will pay special attention to - you guessed it - power and money. At the end of the day, those two forces make the world go round and will make or break decarbonization.";;1701;26;20;3;3;3;3;3;3;3;3
International and Public Affairs;IAPA 1802M;Rwanda Past and Present;In the mid-1990s, few countries on earth were as devastated as Rwanda. As many as one million people or more had been killed in a 100-day genocide, and the fleeing regime had left the country in ruins. Today, however, Rwanda is not only at peace but full of ambition. Some believe it is poised to rise from poverty and become an example for developing countries everywhere.

As such, the prerequisites for this course are: ITAL0200, ITAL0110, or an equivalent score on the placement exam. The course aims to improve students’ capabilities in reading, writing, and speaking Italian through a variety of different assignments, and to give students a more contextualized understanding of Italian culture.

This section of ITAL0300 was taught by Filomena Fantarella, a Post-Doctoral Fellow in Italian Studies. Students noted that she employed a Socratic teaching style to encourage participation in class. They agreed that this method of active learning was particularly effective for the study of a new language, and provided opportunities to practice their skills. Reviewers also mentioned that Fantarella was available after class and in office hours, and provided helpful feedback on assignments.

Coursework for “Intermediate Italian I” included daily homework, weekly quizzes, short writing assignments, three films, and a few short exams. Students felt that the assignments were not too challenging and graded fairly.

One respondent suggested that there should be opportunities for students to be challenged with more rigorous assignments, while another recommended that new material should be introduced at a slower pace.

Students will discuss various aspects of contemporary Italian culture. Reading, analysis and class discussion of texts (articles, songs, pictures, short stories, movies and television), oral presentations, based on research, and a writing portfolio (compositions, essays, blog and a journal). Prerequisites: ITAL 0400, or placement by examination.;"*Please note that this course was taught online – this review may not be reflective of future semesters*

Taught by Professor Cristina Abbona-Sneider, ""Advanced Italian I"" (ITAL0500) is a course aimed at helping students develop stronger speaking and writing skills in Italian as well as discuss contemporary Italian works through oral presentations and writing portfolios. It also serves as an introduction to modern Italian culture and society to enforce students' understanding of global themes including immigration, stereotypes, politics, family and gender, and food. Although this course does not cover basic grammar taught in previous Italian language courses, constructing and editing essays are meant to aid students in refining their writing. Required prerequisites include ITAL0400 or a sufficient knowledge of the language.

Reviewers recounted Professor Abbona-Sneider as ""warm, welcoming, and encouraging of everyone's participation"" and even ""the best professor at Brown"". She was described as passionate about the material and approachable to class members for questions or additional advice.

Course requirements involved daily readings, assigned films to be watched asynchronously prior to each class, multiple responses every week, four papers excluding the final, and one group presentation. Students noted that Professor Abbona-Sneider fostered a comfortable learning environment that helped develop their confidence in speaking Italian and that the assignments were relevant and helpful. On average, reviewers spent four to five hours outside of class weekly on the material with a maximum of 11 hours.

All in all, students thoroughly enjoyed this class, particularly emphasizing the modern Italian culture component in contrast to previous Italian courses. Most respondents felt that they would recommend it to prospective students looking to improve and refine their Italian.";500;14;3;1;1;0;1;0;1;11am;Morning
Italian;ITAL 0960;Bella Ciao: Resistances in Contemporary Italian Culture;What does it mean to resist? This course explores the concept of resistance in its multiple cultural representations. Starting from the partisan Resistance against the Nazi-Fascist regime (1943-45), we will touch upon several historical uprisings: civil rights movements, feminist movements, the so-called Years of Lead, anti-mafia activism, anti-globalization movements, antiracist activism. From literature to film/tv series, from photography to visual art to poetry, artists have politically engaged, challenged and modified the idea of resistance embedded within the identity of contemporary Italians. We look at artistic expressions of resistance performed against different forms of power (nationalism, the colonial state, the patriarchal family, the Mafia, the Church, police violence). We interrogate how the idea of resistance comes to structure Italian culture today and how it reverberates in mainstream narratives of what it means to be Italian.;;960;14;4;1;3;3;3;3;3;3;3
Italian;ITAL 1001;Borders, Belonging, and Memory in the Black Mediterranean;How do histories of empire and extraction bear on the contemporary Mediterranean? How have scholars, writers, and artists documented and responded to these dynamics? In this course, we will examine the relationship between (post)coloniality, race, and mobility, focusing in particular on the expanding body of scholarly, literary, and artistic work on the Black Mediterranean. Looking both within and beyond Italy, we will consider how shifting notions of belonging shape Italian society and Europe more broadly, and how a Black Mediterranean framework can inform understandings of borders, migration, citizenship, and questions of racial and social justice.;;1001;14;5;2;0;1;0;1;0;4pm;Afternoon

Class, Gender, Race, Ideology in the Cinema of the Economic Miracle;Grappling with migration, class struggle, ethnic, gender and generational conflicts, environmental upheavals, counter-cultural movements and a profound ideological polarization, Italy in the 1960s provides a striking historical laboratory for our contemporary predicaments. We will watch a selection of films from the golden decade of Italian cinema, focusing in particular on how modernist masters such as Antonioni, Fellini and Pasolini, and young auteurs such as Bellocchio, Bertolucci and Cavani, forged original styles and expressive techniques in order to capture and denounce the contradictions of a neo-capitalist society.

Italian;ITAL 1100;Fissare Il Tempo. Scrittura E Fotografia/Freezing Time. Writing and Photography;With the invention of photography, writing too, whether philosophical or literary, inaugurates a new way of freezing time, looking at the world, and confronting memory. From Italo Calvino to Giorgio Agamben, from Leonardo Sciascia to Mario Praz, from Lalla Romano to Antonio Tabucchi or more recent authors (Helena Janeczek or Paolo Maurensig), writing negotiates with photographic images, thematizing them or incorporating them into its textual body. This course will seek to interrogate how enduring images of things are imprinted in writing or, conversely, how writing invents its own photographic gaze. This course will be taught in Italian. Prerequisite: Italian 0600, Brown in Bologna Program or placement. Contact the instructor to verify your proficiency if you have not taken Italian at Brown. WRIT.

Italian;ITAL 1320;Great Authors and Works of Italian Renaissance;"This class is a reading of the most successful narrative poem of the Early Modern period, Ariosto’s Orlando furioso (The Madness of Orlando, 1516-32), a work so popular it increased European literacy and rivaled the Bible in editions published. It combined the genres of chivalric romance and religious war with the classic heroic epic, but features ladies-errant along with knights and shrewdly undermined hypermasculine late feudalism (the philosopher Hegel said it had destroyed chivalry). It drove Cervantes’ Don Quixote mad, fueled a fierce debate regarding Tasso’s counter-reformation epic Jerusalem Delivered, and in England influenced Sidney, Spenser, Shakespeare, and Lord Byron. Sections in English and Italian (depending on enrollment); we will have access to a new translation by a leading contemporary Ariosto scholar, Albert Ascoli.";;1320;14;10;3;0;1;0;1;0;10:30am;Morning

The lecture was guided by PowerPoint presentations of new grammar structures and vocabulary, which was then followed by group/pair practices. Students universally praised all the professors for being very passionate, caring, and engaging. Many reviewers also appreciated the sense of community in the small class and the numerous bonding activities outside the classroom, such as Language Table and onigiri-making. Most students noted that all the instructors were very available after class and would actively reach out to everyone who was struggling and falling behind. Reviewers especially appreciated the many office hours and timely feedback from the instructors.

Assignments consisted of daily homework, two writing projects, and one final presentation. In addition, there were weekly quizzes and chapter exams for grammar and vocabulary. Most reviewers thought that the assignments were straightforward and relevant to the course material. However, they cautioned that the preparation for the quizzes and exams could be highly time-consuming, but many agreed that they were good practice and helped them enormously in learning the language.

All in all, nearly all the students enjoyed this course and thought the instructors were the most memorable part. However, a few students also noted that the slight inconsistencies in the lecture styles of the different instructors sometimes made the classroom activities confusing and overwhelming.

In general, the class was described as “structured but fun.” Professor Tajima was readily available outside of class.

Coursework for the class consisted of weekly readings, two group essays, one individual essay, one short presentation, several film summaries, and midterm exams. Students felt that the assignments were very relevant and worthwhile. The workload was manageable and the perceived difficulty of the class differed between students. As one student said, “You get out what you put in.”

Overall, students enjoyed the content of JAPN0700 and recommended it to prospective students. Many students emphasized the relaxing atmosphere and interdisciplinary nature of the class, since it touched on issues relevant to the modern day. Students suggested that the class could place greater stress on grammar, and requested more detailed feedback.

No background is required and students did not find any necessary.

Reviewers found that Visiting Lecturer Hyun Ju Ha taught the course in an extremely clear and effective manner. Students wrote that she was extremely knowledgeable about both Korean and English, as well as about the objectives of the class. The professor was engaged in student learning, making sure to answer any questions, particularly those that arose with new material. The class used a combination of handouts, PowerPoint presentations, and lectures. Professor Ha held weekly office hours and was available by appointment and email. Students found Professor Ha extremely accessible, calling her a kind and funny professor.

Assignments consisted of weekly homework, eight vocabulary quizzes (each covering a chapter), four exams (each covering two chapters), an oral interview, a final, and two major presentations. The homework mainly came from the workbook, consisting of written, listening, and speaking portions. One presentation was in English on Korean culture. The other presentation was in Korean on campus life. Participation in class was mandatory and solely in Korean. Students found this extremely helpful in solidifying ideas. Assignments and exams were fair and based on class material.

Students really enjoyed the small, interactive nature of the class, which let them really get to know each other. Professor Ha was extremely enthusiastic, which made students “excited for class everyday!” Consider shopping KREA100 if you want to learn Korean in a fun and friendly environment.

Literary Arts;LITR 0210A;Fiction Writing II;Topics often include stylistic matters related to tone and point of view, and structural matters like controlling switches in time. See general course description above for course entry procedures for all intermediate workshops. Enrollment limited to 17. Instructor permission required. S/NC.;"Interested in improving your creative writing skills? Then consider Professor Chika Unigwe's ""Fiction Writing II"" (LITR0210A)! ""Fiction Writing II"" focuses on ""stylistic matters related to tone and point of view, and structural matters like controlling switches in time,"" per the course description. Although this workshop has no official prerequisites, non-concentrators have to submit a writing sample in order to enroll. Many students mentioned that they had taken ""Fiction I"" (LITR0110A) or other creative writing courses.

Professor Unigwe was well-received by her students, with one even exclaiming, ""Chika is a wonderful and funny woman! 10/10 would recommend."" Respondents remarked that she sometimes had trouble controlling class but appreciated her feedback on their writing and noted that she encouraged everyone to participate in class. They also enjoyed how she incorporated African literature into the course. Reviewers noted that Professor Unigwe was very accessible and responded promptly to emails.

Assignments for the course included one short story a week, weekly readings, and a final portfolio of their stories. All students had their work workshopped twice during the semester. Respondents found these assignments to be highly relevant and, for the most part, not difficult, though there were some that noted that the work would sometimes be overwhelming.

Overall, students enjoyed Professor Unigwe and her class, but recommended more in-class exercises, more relevant PowerPoint slides on writing techniques, and fully discussing the weekly readings in future iterations of this course. For those interested in the course, reviewers recommended also shopping other Literary Arts workshops, including ""Fiction I"" (LITR0110A), ""Poetry I"" (LITR0110B), and ""Poetry Writing II"" (LITR0210B). For the most part, however, students overwhelmingly recommended this course, with one declaring ""Take Fiction II with Chika, she's amazing!""";210;19;2;1;0;0;1;0;0;5:45pm;Evening
Literary Arts;LITR 0210B;Poetry Writing II;Emphasis is placed on verse strategies, meter, rhythm, imagery and rhyme. Writing includes frequent exercises in various poetic traditions. See general course description above for course entry procedures for all intermediate workshops. Written permission required. S/NC.;"“Poetry II” is a Literary Arts workshop designed to help student better their understanding of poetry and the many ways one can create it. In addition to improving poetry-writing abilities, the course is also intended to foster the skills of reading, writing, discussing, and evaluating poetry. With the exception of declared Literary Arts concentrators, students must submit an application for this course, but it has no formal prerequisites. Other workshops were found to be a helpful background, but not necessary to take the course.

Stephen Williams, the instructor of the course, was generally well-liked by his students. The students wrote that he was interesting but very laid back, he was praised for his ability to make everyone feel comfortable and create an environment for open class discussion. According to the respondents, he made himself very available to meet, and really let students choose how the class was run. Though some reviewers said that this sometimes led to awkward silences, the class tended to enjoy their group workshops. Respondents also commented on his thoughtful and positive feedback on their work. The general consensus was that while he was not always the most effective instructor, he was always engaged and eager to discuss.

Survey respondents were split in their opinions on the assigned readings. Some found it a great selection, but many felt that the text choices were perhaps a bit too avant-garde. Some also felt that the reading list was excessive. Other than readings, the course required students to write a poem every week, and on final 3-5 page response paper.

The amount of time spent outside of class for Poetry II varied, but students generally felt that the workload was reasonable. Students recommended the course enthusiastically to others, but with the caveat that you should be sure you actually like writing poetry. Though feedback from peers is not always constructive, most respondents highly suggested taking this or another Literary Arts workshop at Brown if you are at all interested.";210;19;3;1;0;0;1;0;0;5:45pm;Evening

This course will include visits to the course by contemporary writers who will read to the class and talk about their work. Enrollment limited to 19 first year students.;"“Writers on Writing Seminar” (LITR0710) is a discussion-based seminar that provides students with a unique opportunity to engage with the authors of their class' readings. The class has no official prerequisites, but some students found it helpful to have some background in reading for critical analysis.

Professor Sawako Nakayasu was praised by her students as a wonderful instructor and discussion facilitator. She was described as easygoing, compassionate, and receptive to student needs. However, some reviewers felt that the class discussions could have been more structured and that the professor could have provided more critical and constructive feedback. Outside of class, the professor made herself very available, with one student describing her as “passionate about seeing us succeed.”

Course assignments included eight books read on a weekly or biweekly basis, each followed by a three-page response paper. Students did not find the assignments difficult, but noted that they were somewhat time-consuming. Overall, class members found the assigned books both relevant and helpful. One reviewer commented that the “wide range of material [covered in class] always gave me something to think about.”

Students enjoyed this course. They loved the opportunity to meet and have conversations with the authors they had been reading. In addition, reviewers also loved Professor Nakayasu and appreciated the opportunity to listen to other students’ stories. As for future improvements for the course, respondents recommended the professor lead longer and more structured discussions and provide a more clear grading rubric. Fellow students are recommended to take this class and also to shop related classes like “Introduction to Fiction” (LITR100A), “Introduction to Poetry” (LITR100B), and “Introduction to Creative Nonfiction” (ENGL0930).";710;19;5;1;0;1;0;1;0;4pm;Afternoon

[MATH 180 may not be taken in addition to MATH 200 or MATH 350.];"Professor Daniel Katz’s “Multivariable Calculus” (MATH0180) lives up to its name. While there are few surprises to be found in the content of the course, the rigor of this course left most with a healthy understanding of multivariable calculus needed to succeed in other STEM classes at Brown. In general, students took this course as a concentration requirement rather than an interest in the subject content alone.

Reviewers described Katz’s teaching style as straightforward and quite rigorous. Many students noted the fast pace of the course, with several describing the ease at which you could fall behind should you fail to stay on top of the required work. Lectures are often crammed with as much content as possible, with answers to student questions often going past the bell. While some reviewers liked that he focussed on student struggles, many others wished he spent more time going over concrete examples. However, many students found “From Last Time” five-minute reviews at the beginning of each class helpful to their understanding of the course content.

Strong study habits are required to succeed in this course. The primary workload consists of weekly homework assignments of 24 questions (12 graded, 12 self-check). Furthermore, there are conference sections with both group problem sets and biweekly quizzes. The two midterm exams and one final exam make up the majority of the final grade. Reviewers described the exams as equally or more difficult than the weekly homework assignments.

Students without a preexisting interest in multivariable calculus are generally advised to avoid this course if it is not a concentration requirement. While many reviewers struggled with the overall difficulty of the course, few argued that they came away from it without learning multivariable calculus.";180;28;5;1;1;0;1;0;1;10am;Morning
Mathematics;MATH 0190;Single Variable Calculus, Part II (Physics/Engineering);"This course, which covers roughly the same material and has the same prerequisites as MATH 100, is intended for students with a special interest in physics or engineering. The main topics are: applications and techniques of integration; sequences, series, and power series methods; parametric equations and polar coordinates; additional topics at instructor's discretion. MATH 190 may not be taken in addition to MATH 100 or MATH 170.";"“Advanced Placement Calculus (Physics/Engineering)” (MATH0190) is a second-semester calculus course meant for students interested in physics and engineering. The course goals include a conceptual understanding of various topics in single-variable calculus and the ability to apply those concepts to work in physics and engineering. Placement in the course is based on high school AP exam scores or scores on placement exams taken at Brown. Unofficial prerequisites include “a firm understanding of calculus in one variable,” including the antiderivatives of many common functions and the proper use of the method of integration by substitution. Survey respondents indicated that a strong background in high school calculus was very important to feel comfortable in the course. Some said that having taken AP Calculus BC is essential for this course while others said that a prospective student with that background (of AP Calc BC) could go straight to MATH0180 or MATH0200.

The graduate student who taught the class, Sam Freedman, received very positive feedback from respondents. Multiple students highlighted his excitement and passion for the material, as well as his in-depth and helpful explanations of more complicated topics. One student also said that although the course was designed with physics and engineering applications in mind, that focus did not exclude in-depth coverage of the math itself. Another student even went so far as to say that Freedman was “my favorite professor this semester” and that “while he sometimes went off on tangents, this made the class so much more engaging.”

The course grade was broken down into many sections, including quizzes, section participation, problem sets, additional “capstone problem sets,” one “computational midterm,” and a take-home final exam. There were also relatively generous cutoffs for letter grades, with the cutoff between A and B “most likely … between 85% and 90%.” The quizzes, proctored on MyLab, were more computational in nature, whereas the regular problem sets were more conceptual. Also, a full rubric for the latter questions was available on Canvas. The two capstone problem sets, which tested students' problem-solving skills, weighted much higher than the other ones and were meant to be “more challenging and time consuming than your standard problem sets."" The computational midterm was essentially designed as an evolution of the MyLab quizzes, whereas the final exam was more akin to a capstone problem set. Students were given 48 hours to complete the final. At the end of the semester, students’ lowest grades in the homework and conference sections were dropped. No late assignments were ever accepted.

Respondents’ overall impression of the class was very positive, with special emphasis given to the enthusiasm and strong teaching skills of the instructing graduate student, Sam Freedman. Prospective students with a sufficient background in single-variable calculus should feel assured in their decision to take this course, which by all accounts was very engaging and educational.";190;28;6;1;1;0;1;0;1;10am;Morning
Mathematics;MATH 0200;Multivariable Calculus (Physics/Engineering);"This course, which covers roughly the same material as MATH 180, is intended for students with a special interest in physics or engineering. The main topics are: geometry of three-dimensional space; partial derivatives; Lagrange multipliers; double, surface, and triple integrals; vector analysis; Stokes' theorem and the divergence theorem, with applications to electrostatics and fluid flow. Prerequisite: MATH 100, MATH 170, or MATH 190, or advanced placement or written permission . [MATH 200 may not be taken in addition to MATH 180 or MATH 350.]";"*Please note that this course was taught online – this review may not be reflective of future semesters*

“Intermediate Calculus (Physics/Engineering)” (MATH0200) is an alternative to the traditional “Intermediate Calculus” (MATH0180) that is intended for those specifically interested in applying the theoretical concepts of the course to physics and engineering. Students are exposed to three-dimensional geometry, various types of integrals, partial derivatives, Lagrange multipliers, Stoke’s theorem, and the divergence theorem. Respondents strongly recommended adhering to the encouraged prerequisite of “Introductory Calculus, Part II” (MATH0100) or an equivalent such as AP Calculus BC. It was also noted that those interested should have a basic understanding of vectors and their manipulations.

Professor Justin Holmer received overwhelming praise for his effectiveness in presenting the materials of the course. He provided lecture notes that allowed students to focus on the concepts being presented and not get distracted by attempting to recreate graphs or diagrams. His asynchronous, video-recorded lectures followed the general pattern of presenting topics and then methodically working through relevant problems, which many felt was extremely helpful in working through homework and quiz questions. However, many respondents also felt this often made lectures dry and tedious, especially given his penchant for long lectures, often capping at four hours a week. Despite his long lectures, students were very appreciative of how he presented material, with one even calling him “one of the best math professors [they’ve] had.”

The assignments for the course consisted of quizzes, problem sets, two midterms, and a final. The quizzes were posted at the beginning of each week and due on Friday. Both lectures and TA sections were noted as being helpful for coursework. Respondents deemed the exams to be fair representations of the material covered in the course and the problems worked through during lecture. It was recommended that the best way to study was by completing as many problems as possible, especially alongside the lecture videos.

In general, reviewers greatly enjoyed the class and Professor Holmer. Anyone needing to take an intermediate calculus course or interested in the material was strongly encouraged to shop this class, especially as an alternative to MATH0180. Because the courses are offered in the same semester, respondents noted that prospective students should shop both to find their preferred professor since the material covered is negligibly different.";200;28;7;1;0;1;0;1;0;1pm;Afternoon

Prerequisites: MATH 0100, MATH 0170, or MATH 0190, or advanced placement or written permission. [MATH 0350 may not be taken in addition to MATH 0180 or MATH 0200.];"“Multivariable Calculus with Theory” (MATH0350) is a third-semester calculus course that covers multivariable calculus with an emphasis on theory and understanding proofs over computation and real-world applications. The topics covered include vector analysis, multiple integration, partial differentiation, line integrals, Green’s theorem, Stoke’s theorem, and the divergence theorem. The official prerequisites for the course are MATH 0100 or equivalent, which students emphasized as necessary for success in the course, along with a strong background in calculus.

Professor Breiner was described by students as an enthusiastic and knowledgeable lecturer; respondents emphasized her command over the material and willingness to answer questions as they came up in class. Students found her lectures to be effective, though fast-paced. Above all, students highlighted the resources Professor Breiner provided and her accessibility for help and questions; they felt that it was clear that she wanted them all to succeed in the course. Students also praised the usefulness of TA and Professor Breiner’s office hours, particularly before exams.

The workload for the class consisted of weekly homework assignments, a midterm, and a final. Many students found the homework very helpful to solidifying their understanding of material from lecture.

In summary, students found “Multivariable Calculus with Theory” to be a rewarding course. Because of its focus on theory, students gained “a very strong understanding and appreciation” for the concepts covered by the class. Respondents emphasized the difficulty of the class content and noted that looking over notes after class was extremely helpful. While not intensely proof-based, students noted that homework and exams required understanding theorems and their proofs from class.

Many respondents found it helpful to have experience writing proofs and an interest in mathematics.

Professor Isabel Vogt received positive reviews from students. Her lectures were described as effective, interesting, and engaging, and she explained difficult concepts in an intuitive way. Class members felt that she cared about her students and reported that she went out of her way to offer review sessions and continue office hours beyond their normal time if needed. Students enjoyed that she used many examples and would break up the lectures with polls to help them understand the material, although a few found that she could sometimes rush through the material. Overall, students agreed that Professor Vogt was the primary reason the course was manageable.

Assignments for the course included a weekly problem set, polls during lectures, two midterms, and a final exam. Respondents noted that the problem sets were often more difficult than the exams but that this difficulty helped the students learn.

Class members emphasized the proof-based and very theoretical nature of the course, saying that it was a good way to develop their proof-writing skills but could be difficult without any prior experience. They suggested that if shoppers are looking for a more application-based approach to math, to consider shopping a different course such as MATH0520.

Modern Culture and Media;MCM 0150;Text/Media/Culture: Theories of Modern Culture and Media;"This introductory course will explore its three key terms ""modern,"" ""culture,"" and ""media"" through a variety of theories, historical narratives, and media objects. We will ask how different media—such as print, photography, cinema, television, digital art, online video, archival practices, and social media—yield distinct modes of seeing, thinking, and feeling, structure the ways we act and engage with the common world, and communicate and collaborate. We will read semiotic theory, critical race studies, feminist, post-colonial, queer and political theory, and examine concepts such as textuality, visuality, and networks. Open to undergraduates only.";"Students enrolled in ""Text/Media/Culture: Readings in Theory"" were introduced to the theoretical foundations of contemporary cultural criticism. Through readings of works by such scholars as Saussure, Marx, Barthes, and Fanon, class members studied theories of language and representation, signification and textuality, and modernity and postmodernity, among others, which have been crucial to understanding modern culture and media texts. There are no formal prerequisites for this course.

Professor Doane received excellent reviews from respondents, who felt that she was a very clear and knowledgeable lecturer. They also noted that her lectures were well-organized and interesting, and reviewers noted that she was ""brilliant"" and ""insightful."" Moreover, Professor Doane helped clarify ideas in class and made difficult material easier to understand. While some class members wished that she was more engaging and allowed more time for questions, most students felt that lectures were well-presented, and one reviewer even felt that he or she ""sometimes got more out of the lectures than the readings.""

Most reviewers reported completing at least half of the required readings, with the majority of them completing between 60% and 90%. While many class members reported thinking the most about a wide variety of texts, the reading that made the majority of them think the least was the Freud. The films were met with mixed reviews, with most students seeing most of them at least once.

The amount of writing done in the class was deemed adequate by most reviewers, who noted that they wanted to pursue various areas of media or theory investigation while at Brown after taking this course. Furthermore, they noted that while the class was challenging, they found the material interesting and worthwhile.";150;18;1;1;1;0;1;0;0;1pm;Afternoon
Modern Culture and Media;MCM 0700A;Introduction to the Production Image;The course will provide students with a basic introduction to digital sound and image acquisition and post-production, and to consider the particular capabilities of these digital technologies, especially as these relate to the production of meaning. Of particular interest will be the representational limits of these technologies at the intersection of science and art. Classes will be organized as workshop environments where extensive class time will be devoted to hands-on learning with digital film cameras, lighting, and digital sound recorders. There are no prerequisites for this class.;N/A;700;18;2;1;0;1;0;1;0;10am;Morning

Modern Culture and Media;MCM 1205A;What We Talk About When We Talk About Horror;The killer, their victims, the ‘terrible place,’ the ‘final girl’: components like these, associated with 1970s American slasher films, tend to dominate popular accounts of the genre—but the cinema of fear and sensation is a dynamic mode of contemporary filmmaking, transnational in its origins and circulation, and thematically and formally eclectic. This course will study the horror genre through scholarly and critical debates, emphasizing the ways both experts and enthusiasts have theorized horror's significance and social urgency, the unique properties of horror spectatorship, and the formal attributes of individual films. Each week will focus on a specific conceptual area, including monstrosity, the uncanny, Otherness, excess, allegory, haunting, and abjection.;;1205;18;5;1;0;1;0;1;0;9am;Morning

Modern Culture and Media;MCM 1205G;Contemporary Black Popular Music;This course provides an introduction to the history of black popular music since the1970s, focusing primarily on sound cultures from the US, Caribbean, and Western Europe. We will begin by studying the mixing techniques developed in Reggae (dub), Disco (remix), and Hip-Hop (scratching and sampling) to discuss how they have shaped popular music since the1970s. We will then survey these genres as well as the histories of R&B, House and Techno and some of their many offshoots (Jungle & Afrobeats, for instance) have developed over the last 30 years to ask how popular music functions as one of the main channels of communication among the cultures of the African diaspora. Overall, this course investigates the aesthetic, political, cultural, and economic dimensions of black popular music, paying particular attention to questions of gender, sexuality, class, nation, language, and technology.;;1205;18;7;2;0;1;0;1;0;2:30pm;Afternoon
Modern Culture and Media;MCM 1205H;Animatedness: Technology, Race, and Moving Images;This course explores the history and theory of animation through the notion of “animatedness,” a concept raised by Sianne Ngai to describe a racialized feeling of being moved both physically and emotionally, an affect that is deeply rooted in the forms and techniques of animation. The state of animatedness, that is, being moved by external forces rather than moving by oneself, is an “ugly feeling” because it foregrounds the lack of agency that is associated with objectified racial or ethnic otherness. It is a racialized feeling situated at the interplay between machine and affect, between power and powerlessness. Centered on the notion of animatedness, the course investigates the animation of racialized bodies in modern media history, examining how the changing techniques, forms, and aesthetics of animation accentuate the intertwined relationship between racial representations and the technological conditions of moving images.;;1205;18;8;2;0;1;0;1;0;6:40pm;Evening
Modern Culture and Media;MCM 1501O;Television, Gender, and Sexuality;"Television, across all the screens on which we view, has an enormous impact on society—including on relations of gender and sexuality—just as it is impacted by those relations in turn. This course investigates how television produces and reproduces constructions of gender and sexuality through its institutional form (as it maps relations between public and private, domestic and social, familial and defamiliarized), narrative patterns (as it circulates family romances, links gender and genre, and mediates sexual and social tensions), and spectatorial relations (as it variously addresses viewers as sexed and gendered subjects, consumers and commodities, ""mainstream"" and marginalized).";;1501;18;9;2;0;1;0;1;0;4pm;Afternoon

Modern Culture and Media;MCM 1505Z;Kiarostami: What is an Image?;In the history of cinema, a small number of directors have been treated as if their work stood for cinema itself. Abbas Kiarostami is one of these. Yet while his films foreground the act of cinema, they also address questions of reality to which the “neorealist” label cannot respond. To existing attempts to analyze his films in this light, we will add a principia domestica. Our question is this: how is it that the mystical, Islamic background from which Kiarostami invents is able to respond to current debates about reality in compelling, modern terms?;;1505;18;11;2;0;0;1;0;0;3pm;Afternoon
Modern Culture and Media;MCM 1506U;Is that a Fact?;"The status of the fact appears threatened. We argue: “you are entitled to your own opinion but not your own facts” to distinguish facts from merely personal, subjective or partisan views. Yet debates rage over the ""factuality"" of deficit projections, scientific observations, and historical legacies. The urgency of the question of the fact paradoxically trains a spotlight on questions of interpretation, criticism, and reading at the present time. This course examines historical and contemporary theories of interpretation and critique, reading and describing, rhetoric and theory, to illuminate the processes of mediation, the work, that establishes realities, confirms and disputes truths, and constitutes facts. We will consider debates in literary studies, philosophy, history, and science studies on the problem of knowledge, subjectivity in disciplinary practices, and the powerful role of the medium in shaping these interpretative events.";;1506;18;12;2;1;0;0;0;0;3pm;Afternoon

Modern Culture and Media;MCM 2310I;At the Limits: Media Representation of the Holocaust;"The Holocaust has been described as unimaginable, at the limits of representation. Yet there have been numerous attempts to imagine and represent it, across media (film, television, graphic novels), genres (documentary, melodrama, comedy, fantasy), and modalities (through history and memory, ""high"" and ""low"" culture, fiction and nonfiction, reporting and marketing). Considering such attempts to represent the unrepresentable and mediate the immediacy of trauma, this course will explore media texts and theoretical/philosophical reflections on the Holocaust. Enrollment limited to 12. This course is for Graduates only. Upperclass undergraduates require instructor's permission.";;2310;18;17;3;0;1;0;0;0;1pm;Afternoon

Modern Greek;MGRK 0100;Introduction to Modern Greek;Designed for students with little or no prior knowledge of Modern Greek. The aim is to introduce students to basic linguistic structures and develop the ability to comprehend and produce text, as well as to speak and understand speech, in a variety of contexts and registers. The course objectives are to enable students to perform a range of tasks, master a minimum core vocabulary and acquire knowledge and understanding of various forms of Greek culture.;"“Introduction to Modern Greek” (MGRK0100) is an introductory course for students to learn the Greek language. Utilizing topics related to Greek culture, the course focuses on the four linguistic skills of speaking, listening, reading, and writing. There are no prerequisites for the class.

Professor Elissavet Amanatidou was highly praised for being thorough, engaging, efficient, accommodating to student needs, and motivating. Respondents also commented favorably on the group discussions and breakout sessions during class, which they found immersed them in the language very quickly and familiarized them with the practical usages of Greek. Professor Amanatidou also frequently checked in with students to ensure they were learning at the same pace. Some reviewers commented that at times the course’s Canvas page felt slightly disorganized, but the Google Doc schedule that Professor Elsa updated regularly resolved this issue.

The course load for MGRK0100 included both written and oral assignments in the forms of daily homework, weekly vocabulary quizzes, and a midterm and final exam. Attendance and participation were also mandatory. Most students often spent about five hours per week completing the assignments and considered the workload both manageable and essential for success. Some students remarked that the coursework became more challenging as more grammar was learned in the latter half of the course, so regularly attending classes and completing routine assignments were crucial to keep up. It helped that Professor Amanatidou graded assignments and returned helpful feedback timely and fairly.

In short, MGRK0100 was enjoyed by students especially because Professor Amanatidou conveyed materials effectively to language learners of any level, challenging and empowering them to approach the language and continue their studies. Students of both Greek heritage and other heritages appreciated the connections to Greek culture that were made in this course and the occasional class times when food was offered.";100;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;0;12pm;Afternoon
Modern Greek;MGRK 0300;Intermediate Modern Greek;Develops linguistic and cultural competence and may be taken by anyone who has completed MGRK 0200 or after consultation with the instructor and/or a placement exam. It focuses on further development of the four language skills as well as knowledge and understanding of various aspects of Greek society. It employs a variety of materials, including film, digital stories, internet based sources, music, art, and literature.;"Still waiting for that ""eureka!"" moment during shopping period? If you have foundational knowledge of modern Greek or have taken the Introduction to Modern Greek sequence, ""Intermediate Modern Greek"" might put you one step closer! This language course seeks to improve students' skills in speaking, writing, reading, and listening to Modern Greek, as well as their understanding of Greek culture. As with most modern language courses, having experience with learning foreign languages proves helpful; some also cited a background in Classics to be useful.

Students praised Professor Elissa Amanatidou, whom they called Elsa, for being fair, clear, and enthusiastic. In particular, they found her ability to illustrate difficult parts of Greek grammar extremely valuable; respondents also wrote that her instruction significantly improved their speaking and listening skills. Reviewers unanimously agreed that Professor Amanatidou actively encouraged questions, took their needs into account, and re-explained concepts as necessary.

Coursework consisted of weekly homework, quizzes, five short writing assignments, two presentations, and two exams. Weekly homework included listening comprehension. This amount of work met reviewers' expectations, though one said that on some days she had significantly more work than others.

All in all, respondents found ""Intermediate Modern Greek"" to be fun and recommended it to other prospective students; reviewers also recommended courses in Greek literature in the Comparative Literature department. They caution that, as with most modern language courses at Brown, prospective students should be prepared to do homework on a regular basis, but also to be rewarded with knowledge of another culture and great fun!

Modern Greek;MGRK 0500;Advanced Modern Greek;May be taken by students who have completed the previous sequences or by anyone who places successfully into the course. The course places emphasis on the improvement of writing and oral skills, via presentations, collaborative projects, conversations and assignments based on topics and texts, drawn from a variety of sources and cultural forms of expression.;"Advanced Modern Greek' is a language course which enhances students’ comprehension and communication abilities. Class members were able to expand upon their previous language skills through discussion as well as written work. Students also have the opportunity to learn about Greek culture and society, as well as history. Modern Greek is explored through various means, including literature, newspapers, music and films. In order to take this course students must have previously completed MG 40, or have sufficient prior experience with the Greek language.

Students describe Professor Elsa Amanatidou as an effective teacher, whose enthusiasm and strong background in the subject greatly enhanced the course. She encouraged students to constantly strive to improve, and was considerate of peoples’ strengths and weaknesses. The small class size facilitated participation, and allowed the professor to pay attention to all students.

Respondents noted that the professor supplied them with many texts, which were interesting and offered insight into Modern Greek life. Textbooks, as well as supplemental reading materials, were used in the course. Coursework consisted of one midterm, one final, and occasional vocabulary quizzes. Workbook exercises were also assigned, as well as one short paper per a week,

On average, students spent between four to eight hours a week doing work outside of class. For individuals interested in further exploring the Greek language, as well as gaining an understanding of life in modern Greece, this course comes highly recommended.";500;5;3;2;0;1;0;1;0;1pm;Afternoon
Modern Greek;MGRK 1010;The Classical World in Film;Why do film directors, Hollywood moguls, and TV executives hark back to antiquity? This course introduces spectacular, epic representations of classical literature, myth, and history alongside more understated, tongue-in-cheek—occasionally hyperbolic—adaptations of that world in the present. Explores how narrative, cinematic technique, audience reception, and political context produce desired effects and elicit incisive commentary on modernity, race, ethnicity, gender. Analysis centered around a cluster of classical texts, heroic and mythic figures, and truly “historical” events. No prior knowledge of classical literature required. Films range from silent movies, Hollywood epics, European auteurism, anti-colonial Third Cinema, gladiatorial kitsch, and sci-fi franchise.;;1010;5;4;3;0;1;0;1;0;1pm;Afternoon
Modern Greek;MGRK 1800;In Other Words: Translating Greece;This is an advanced undergraduate seminar that will offer students the opportunity to build on their linguistic, cultural and critical literacies, by translating from Greek into English. Over the course of the semester we will be thinking critically about texts, their ideological, historical and social coordinates and their embedded discourses of Greekness, community, diglossia, identity and gender, among others. In addition to translating from Greek into English, we will read and discuss essays on translation, in order to consider in an informed way the issues (untranslatability?) and types of decision making associated with the practice of translation.;;1800;5;5;3;3;3;3;3;3;3;3
Public Affairs;MPA 2055;The Politics of Policymaking in Comparative Perspective;This course provides concepts and tools for thinking critically about the political context in which policy is made and implemented. The course examines the underlying ideas, interests, and historical legacies that make politics and policymaking distinctive in different countries and governmental systems. It aims to supply a simple but flexible conceptual toolbox that enables students to define policy challenges as they take shape, propose programs and implement policies that can work in various settings.;;2055;5;1;1;0;1;0;0;0;4pm;Afternoon
Public Affairs;MPA 2065;Introduction to Data Science and Programming;We live in the era of data-driven decision making in all aspects of our lives. The features on your iPhone, the images in an ad campaign, even the background colors on many websites are all carefully tested and chosen against their measurable impact on customer satisfaction, purchasing, clicks, or some other goal. In this course, we will be learning to use and apply those same principles to public policy and government programs. Our goal is to equip MPA students with the tools required to set up experiments, gather data, and begin to evaluate and design public policy and government programs.;;2065;5;2;2;3;3;3;3;3;3;3
Public Affairs;MPA 2229;Principles and Practices of Stakeholder Engagement;"This class will introduce you to various types of policy stakeholders, from executives to the mass public. You will identify those actors, the combination of authorities, powers, interests, and constraints each one possesses. This framework for viewing stakeholders will enable you to strategize about how to engage different actors when and where they intervene in the policy process. As a policymaker, analyst, or advocate, you will have to contend with stakeholders that possess formal authorities to shape the policy process. These stakeholders will determine whether the problems that concern you reach the agenda; whether your preferred solution is adopted; how that policy solution is implemented; whether it diffuses from one political venue to another; and whether the policy endures, or reshapes politics, succumbs to termination or reform. We will catalog those authorities and powers and observe how they apply in real policy situations.";;2229;5;3;2;0;0;1;0;0;3pm;Afternoon
Public Affairs;MPA 2445;Policy Analysis and Problem Solving;This course introduces students to concepts and tools relevant to making public decisions informed by social values. It equips students to define problems and to systematically develop and compare policy options available to public actors. In short, the course teaches students to “think like a policy analyst” and reason in the public interest. In addition, the course is attentive to the political and institutional context in which policy decisions are made.;;2445;5;4;3;0;1;0;1;0;10:30am;Morning
Public Affairs;MPA 2605;Translating Evidence into Economic Policy;The objective of this course is, precisely, to offer those insights to students interested in a career in policymaking by providing case studies of the most important and challenging policy questions of our lifetimes. By the end of the course, students will have deepened their understanding of the most important policy challenges from an array of different policy questions and studying the evidence around them, with a special focus on quantitative methods useful to analyze those questions.;;2605;5;5;3;1;0;0;0;0;3pm;Afternoon
Music;MUSC 0021J;Stephen Sondheim and the American Musical;This seminar considers the theater shows of Stephen Sondheim in relation to the history of the American musical. Through close study of selected scenes and shows, we examine how and why Sondheim and his collaborators “reinvented” the genre. Special emphasis will be given to Sondheim's critical skepticism concerning the myths, characters, and ethos of social optimism that have been central to the Broadway tradition. We examine links between the shows and post-WWII historical contexts, and consider the political implications of the circumscribed social universe—predominantly white, urban, and affluent—within which most of his shows take place.;"""Stephen Sondheim and the American Musical"" (MUSC0021J) is a first year seminar exploring American history through musical theater, with a particular focus on the work of Stephen Sondheim. The course requires no prerequisites, though reviewers mentioned that a background in music theory was helpful for understanding the more technical analysis of the music.

Reviewers described Professor Dana Gooley as passionate and knowledgeable. They found Professor Gooley to be very approachable and accessible outside of class. His teaching style was described as very lecture-heavy, with less time for seminar-style discussions.

Students spent an average of five hours per week on the class. Assignments included several 250-word short written responses, a midterm performance project, and one six-to-eight page paper at the end of the semester. Reviewers particularly enjoyed the close analysis of the music and lyrics, and found the short canvas assignments very helpful in preparing for lectures. Common highlights included the hands-on experiences, including interviews with playwrights and a trip to see the musical ""Assassins"" on Broadway.

Overall, this seminar was especially enjoyed by self-described “theater kids,” who found it to be a good way to connect with other like-minded first-years and learn about a common interest.";21;33;1;1;0;1;0;1;0;10:30am;Morning
Music;MUSC 0021L;Music and War;"Where there is war, there is music – to incite violence and mobilize armies; to express resistance, protest and patriotism; to bear witness to pain and memorialize victims; to heal from trauma and to build peace. How can music fulfill such different roles? Beyond the notes and words, how does music exercise such extraordinary power, especially in times of conflict, suffering and survival? Using texts, audio recordings, films and iconographic materials, this course explores the ways in which people have made music in relation to militarized conflicts and considers more broadly the nature of music and sound in the human experience.";;21;33;2;1;3;3;3;3;3;3;3

MUSC 0550 is a prerequisite to many music courses and is a requirement for the music concentration.;"“Theory of Tonal Music I” (MUSC0550) is an “intensive study of the building blocks of tonal music traditions,” according to the course description. It is the first part of a year-long course progression; students are encouraged to take MUSC0560 or MUSC0570 in the spring. Students are required to take a placement course at the beginning of the semester to ensure they are prepared for the course, and most students took MUSC0400A/B and had extensive experience playing a musical instrument before taking “Theory of Tonal Music I.”

Professor Mark Steinbach combined lecture with student participation; respondents praised his use of the whiteboard and external camera to show “worked examples” over the Zoom format. Professor Steinbach was described as “incredibly passionate” and dedicated to facilitating student engagement. He did this by cold-calling students throughout class, which respondents found to be stressful but effective at ensuring they paid attention. Professor Steinbach had high expectations for his students, but he was compassionate and never got upset if students did not know an answer. He also encouraged students’ questions.

“Theory of Tonal Music I” was a time-intensive course. Students were required to complete readings prior to each class, workbook exercises and homework corrections twice a week, a two-hour midterm exam, and a final exam. Students were also required to sign up for a lab that met hourly three times a week. Respondents reported spending 2-4 hours on each homework assignment, and the lab was described as time-consuming for a fifth course.

Students enjoyed MUSC0550, but they warn prospective shoppers to be ready for the intense time commitment. Professor Steinbach will be remembered for his “jovial attitude” that created a relaxed environment and made attendance worthwhile. As one respondent summarized, this is not an easy 4th course, but MUSC0550 is fantastic if you’re willing to work for it.

We begin with the traditional arguments for God’s existence: Did God cause the universe? Is the universe designed? Should we believe in miracles? Then we will consider the traditional arguments against God’s existence: Can there be an all knowing or all power being? Does evil in the world show there is no God? We conclude with questions regarding faith: What is faith? Is faith without evidence rational? Is belief required for faith?;;14;23;1;1;3;3;3;3;3;3;3
Philosophy;PHIL 0017;Animal Ethics;"This course is an introductory survey of philosophical issues in animal ethics. We affect the lives of non-human animals in myriad ways. What moral obligations do we have towards them? For example, is it wrong to eat meat? To experiment on animals? To keep pets? Should we try to reduce predation? How (morally) important is it that we save endangered species? Some take these to be among the most important ethical questions of our time. We will start with a brief overview of animal minds; then we’ll examine several contemporary theories of animal ethics. Along the way, we’ll pay careful attention to the implications of philosophy for everyday life.";N/A;17;23;2;1;0;1;0;1;0;9am;Morning
Philosophy;PHIL 0019;Implicit Bias: What is it, Who is to Blame and What’s Next?;In daily life, we might experience or exhibit various forms of implicit bias, e.g. experiencing anxiety when walking past individuals from certain racial groups, or being surprised by female students’ achievement in science classes. How should we understand implicit bias? What’s the mechanism of it? In this course, we will explore two fundamental aspects of implicit bias, i.e. its nature and its corresponding moral blameworthiness. This course is designed to be interdisciplinary and to equip students with the ability to critically analyze the everyday phenomena of implicit bias and rethink about the moral blameworthiness of implicit bias in real life cases.;N/A;19;23;3;1;0;1;0;1;0;2:30pm;Afternoon
Philosophy;PHIL 0110;Ancient Greek Philosophy;"This course will introduce students to the major concerns of Greek philosophy, and how they are addressed by the Presocratics, Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics. We will have two related ends: historical and critical. On the one hand, we will get clear so far as we are able what it is that these thinkers thought; on the other, it is important to evaluate their arguments. This course will emphasize the identification of the problems and the solutions to them that seemed pressing to these thinkers, especially if such problems seem alien to us.";;110;23;4;1;3;3;3;3;3;3;3
Philosophy;PHIL 0200H;Contemporary Ethical Issues;"Are we morally obligated to reduce greenhouse gas emissions? Do we have moral obligations toward nature, animals and other people, for instance future generations and refugees? Is abortion morally wrong? Is legalization of drugs the right thing to do? In this course we will explore these and other contemporary ethical issues in the context of important moral theories; utilitarianism, virtue ethics, and the social contract theory. This course will serve as an introduction to applied ethics and normative ethics.";;200;23;5;1;3;3;3;3;3;3;3
Philosophy;PHIL 0401;Ethics of Digital Technology;As the capacities of digital technology have increased, it has entered (almost) every domain of our lives. Algorithmic models, Artificial Intelligence, and everyday processing of vast amounts of data increasingly shape both our private choices and opportunities, and also our interactions in the public sphere. These developments raise new ethical and normative political questions and prompt us to examine the role of values such as freedom, autonomy, equality, and privacy in the digital sphere. How should a self-driving car behave when a crash is unavoidable? Are engineers responsible for the decisions of artificially-intelligent systems? What is the value of privacy in a world that increasingly depends on large amounts of data about customers, citizens, or patients? How does the algorithmic curating of content relate to freedom of expression? These and other topics will be the focus of this course.;"“Ethics of Digital Technology” (PHIL0401) is a philosophical inquiry into the emerging ethics of the digital age. The course examines issues and ethical questions surrounding artificial intelligence, algorithmic curation, self-driving cars, privacy, equality, and freedom. Students did not recommend any prior experience to take the class, but some said basic knowledge of technological issues or the philosophy of ethics was useful.

Professor Julia Netter was praised as an effective lecturer whose passion was “contagious.” Though some students noted the relative lack of structure in her classes, which did not include lecture slides, many respondents enjoyed the variety, mentioning the opportunities for discussion and class-wide polls. Grading was characterized as fair and timely, and Professor Netter was receptive to students’ needs and made herself available for useful feedback.

Assignments consisted of readings, weekly discussion posts, two papers, and a final project. Respondents called the readings interesting but not strictly necessary for the class, and very few students found them to be too challenging. Most students reported spending around three hours per week on classwork, with a maximum of around ten hours in a week.

Overall, students enjoyed the class, but considered it important to have some kind of interest in technology or philosophy. Respondents liked Professor Netter’s teaching style and personability, with one noting that she learned everyone’s names within the first few weeks of class. The course was considered valuable for its exploration of the implications of our societal relationship with technology today, and most students recommended taking the class to better understand these relevant issues. Few respondents were concentrators.

Philosophy;PHIL 0555;Choice, Commerce, and Conflict: An Introduction to PPE;This interdisciplinary course provides an overview of some of the core conceptual tools used to analyze issues at the intersection of philosophy, politics, and economics (PPE). A range of theoretical topics are covered, including: game theory, property, markets, distributive justice, public choice theory, voting, and more. We will read classical and contemporary sources on these topics as well as explore their applications to contemporary social problems (including: climate change, healthcare rationing, price gouging, universal basic income, pharmaceutical regulations, and others).;"“Choice, Commerce, and Conflict: An Introduction to PPE” (PHIL0555) takes an interdisciplinary dive into many of today’s problems through the lens of philosophy, politics, and economics. The course initially focuses on game theory and then delves more into philosophy and politics. This small class combines both clearly focused lectures and deep discussion for a truly engaging course. Respondents indicated that no prerequisites were necessary and that an interest in the material was enough to do well.

Students described Professor Ryan Doody as “a truly extraordinary professor” who possesses a real passion for the material. With well-thought-out lectures and PowerPoints, students found the material easy to follow and incredibly clear. He also incorporated lots of activities and discussions into class time, and most students found the classes to be very engaging. While most enjoyed Professor Doody’s inclusion of student ideas and willingness to answer questions quite helpful, some felt that additional questions were required for him to go more into depth.

Each class began with a bit of review which students thought effectively reinforced concepts and permitted connections to new material. The course consisted of readings for each class accompanied by a weekly discussion post graded on completion. Students felt the variety of “readings” from podcasts to news articles and even online games created enjoyable variety. Respondents also emphasized that the readings were not all ""old philosophers"" as they often engaged with contemporary sources. Weekly, there were one to two open note take-home quizzes from that week’s material. Both the midterm and final were take-home exams and consisted of multiple-choice, short answer, and essay components that were described as not overly difficult.

Students highly recommended this course for its fascinating material and charismatic professor. With the work never feeling like a chore, some even felt it was their favorite class at Brown. Students appreciated the breadth of the course and its applicability to the world today, providing a solid background for many other classes. Professor Doody’s own views did not influence what he taught as he always sure to show both sides to the material. If you are looking for a course with engaging readings, discussion, and a professor who is very passionate to share his knowledge, then this is the course for you.";555;23;7;1;0;1;0;1;0;2:30pm;Afternoon

Philosophy;PHIL 0652;Introduction to Continental Philosophy: Self, Society, Science;In this course, we will read some of the most influential European philosophers of the 20th and late 19th centuries, including Jean-Paul Sartre, Hannah Arendt, Martin Heidegger, and Friedrich Nietzsche. Our aim will be to get a general understanding of the major themes and ideas of these enduringly influential figures, as well as to see how we might apply their ideas in our own lives. To structure our studies, we will concentrate on questions about the self and our freedom: are there natural laws of the mind, or of societies? Are we who we choose to be, or who we are born to be? Can science help answer these questions, or are they beyond its limits? In taking up these questions, we will join one of the most exciting and extensively studied philosophical conversations of the last hundred years.;N/A;652;23;9;2;1;0;1;0;1;12pm;Afternoon
Philosophy;PHIL 0992A;Puzzles of Rationality;What is it to be rational? This course takes up that question by looking at a number of intriguing puzzles. For example: Is it irrational to not believe in God? Is it irrational to settle for less now when you could have more later? Is it irrational to intend to do something that you don't believe you'll do? Can it be rational to do what you hope you won't? When is it rational to be random? Is it ever rational to be irrational? Along the way, we will learn bayesian probability theory, decision theory, game theory, and social choice theory.;N/A;992;23;10;2;0;1;0;1;0;1pm;Afternoon
Philosophy;PHIL 0998;Kant's Critique of Pure Reason;This is an undergraduate seminar on the mature work of the German philosopher Immanuel Kant. Since the 18th century, few philosophers have more profoundly impacted the disciplines of epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of mind, and moral philosophy than Kant. We will be reading Kant’s magnum opus, the Critique of Pure Reason (1781/1787). Topics discussed will include: the nature and possibility of metaphysics, the relationship between the mind and the world, the nature of space and time, the structure of experience, self-consciousness, and freedom and determinism.;N/A;998;23;11;2;0;1;0;1;0;9am;Morning

We then move on to the major ""limitative"" results, including the undecidability of first-order logic, the Gödel incompleteness theorems, and the undefinability in arithmetic of arithmetical truth. Prerequisite: PHIL 0540 or instructor's permission.";;1635;23;13;2;1;0;1;0;1;2pm;Afternoon
Philosophy;PHIL 1705;Epistemology;We’ll concentrate on several issues involving knowledge and rational belief: What is knowledge, and how does it relate to rational or justified belief? Does a person’s knowing something depend on non-evidential factors such as the practical importance of the person’s being correct? Does the justification of a person’s belief depend just on facts internal to the person—or might it depend on her environment? And what can we learn from thinking about the skeptical position which claims that we’re not justified in believing even the most ordinary things about the world around us? Pre-req: Must have taken one course in Philosophy.;;1705;23;14;2;0;1;0;1;0;2:30pm;Afternoon

Philosophy;PHIL 2132;Physicalism;"This seminar will examine the thesis of physicalism about the natural world: roughly, the idea that everything is fundamentally physical. We will start by looking at a very austere form of physicalism, ""identification physicalism"", that offers an attractively simple and uniform picture of nature. This kind of physicalism, or something like it, has been defended by David Lewis, Ted Sider, and Cian Dorr. We will consider some new arguments against identification physicalism that are off the beaten path: arguments from the special intentional character of consciousness, arguments from the epistemic and normative significance of consciousness, and arguments based on the ease with which we can determinately think and talk about our own conscious states.";;2132;23;19;3;0;0;1;0;0;3pm;Afternoon
Philosophy;PHIL 2410;Moral Psychology;This seminar will examine in depth some problems associated with morality, rationality, and the human psyche.

Undergraduates require instructor permission to enroll.;;2410;23;20;3;3;3;3;3;3;3;3
Philosophy;PHIL 2510;Non-Naturalist Moral Realism;This seminar will examine recent metaethical theories, both ‘robust’ and ‘quietist’, that take basic moral expressions to pick out non-natural properties. In the first part we will look at the reasons non-naturalists give in favor of their view: that naturalism does not work, that expressivism is defective, that robust normative properties are needed to explain certain features of our normative practice and experience. In the second part we will see how they reply to the most significant objections to the view: epistemological, metaphysical, moral psychological. At the end we will raise and attempt to answer some metametaethical questions, particularly those arising from “quietist” conception of their own view (namely, that it has no ontological commitments).;;2510;23;21;3;3;3;3;3;3;3;3

Public Health;PHP 0060;Complexities and Challenges of Global Health;Global health refers to the health and wellbeing of all of the world’s populations, regardless of geography, country, or citizenship. Many of today’s most pressing issues, from climate change to political conflict and population displacement, have profound implications for health. This course will introduce students to fundamental topics in global health, and it will encourage them to approach global health issues through a lens of equity and responsibility toward people and populations beyond United States’ borders. Students will develop a framework for understanding contemporary health challenges and learn how responses to these complex problems require collaboration across health and non-health sectors of society. This course will challenge students’ assumptions about world health while strengthening their skills in data literacy and critical analysis.;N/A;60;67;1;1;0;1;0;1;0;1pm;Afternoon
Public Health;PHP 0310;Health Care in the United States;"Introduction to the health care delivery system. An overview of the U.S. health care financing, delivery and regulatory system. Considers the interaction between paying for and providing and assuring the quality of health services; changes in one component of the system inevitably affect the others. Addresses the balance between employer funded health insurance, publicly funded health insurance and the consequences of not being insured. Six discussion sections will be arranged. Open to undergraduates only. This is a core class for the concentration in public health.";"“Health Care in the United States” (PHP0310) is a lecture-based introductory course that provides a general overview of the United States’ healthcare financing, delivery, and regulatory systems. This course has no official prerequisites, and most students found that prior knowledge and experience (while potentially helpful) were not necessary for success.

Professor Ira Wilson was overwhelmingly praised by students for being an extremely animated, engaging, organized, knowledgeable, clear, and passionate lecturer, with one student even commenting: “he is [just] so jolly and cheerful.” Reviewers adored Professor Wilson’s ability to captivate their attention for the entire class period, highlighting his integration of personal experiences and case studies with course material to make for fascinating and insightful lectures. Some respondents felt that class moved a little too quickly, but they acknowledged that the posted lecture slides and recordings alleviated these concerns. Additionally, while class members did appreciate the professor’s effort to bring a variety of somewhat useful guest lectures to the course, most respondents heavily preferred to have Professor Wilson teach instead.

Students generally felt that the workload for PHP0310 was very light. Assignments, most of which were very relevant to the course, consisted of various readings for each lecture, six short writing assignments graded on completion, one out-of-class, open-book quiz for each lecture (with unlimited attempts, all due at the end of the course), and three exams (two midterm exams and one final exam), all of which were made up of multiple choice and true/false questions.

Overall, respondents felt that PHP0310 was a fantastic class that taught a plethora of practical information regarding the United States healthcare system. Students found that the course content could be applied to a wide variety of disciplines, emphasizing this course’s great relevance to their futures. Effort appears to be the main key to success in this course, with reviewers indicating the essentiality of consistent attendance of review sessions and detailed reviews of past slideshows and quizzes to prepare for exams. One student said it best, simply stating: “Everyone should take this class.”";310;67;2;1;0;1;0;1;0;4pm;Afternoon

Public Health;PHP 1450;COVID-19, Public Health, and Health Policy;The impact of COVID-19 on US society has been profound. Caused by the newly emergent SAR-COV2 virus, the pandemic required public health practitioners and healthcare systems to pivot to keep the public safe under challenging circumstances. In the US, local municipalities, state governments, and the federal government developed varying, and at times conflicting, policies to guide the public health response. Using a case-study approach, this course will explore how public health and health policy intersected and clashed in responding to this 100-year pandemic. We will examine how different states and federal agencies responded to COVID-19 and learn from leaders directly involved in the pandemic response.;;1450;67;8;1;0;1;0;0;0;4pm;Afternoon
Public Health;PHP 1460;Public Health in a Changing World: Law, Policy & Justice;"Laws and policies shape public health in profound ways. The U.S. Constitution frames and limits government authority to protect and promote public health. It also provides protections for individual rights that often are in tension with public health’s focus on the common good. Federal, state and local laws and policies structure the distribution of society’s resources and—as interpreted, implemented and enforced—can have serious implications for health equity. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed deeply polarized views among Americans about the role of government in public health and has laid bare vast structural health inequities. This course will explore the Constitutional foundations of public health law; how public health powers are distributed across different levels and branches of government; legal and policy strategies for addressing infectious and chronic diseases and injuries; and the role of laws and policies in structuring—and remedying—health inequities.";;1460;67;9;1;0;1;0;1;0;9am;Morning

Physics;PHYS 0040;Basic Physics B;Survey of electricity, magnetism, optics, and modern physics for concentrators in sciences other than physics-including premedical students or students without prior exposure to physics who require a less rigorous course than PHYS 0050, 0060. Lectures, conferences, and laboratory.;"“Basic Physics B” (PHYS0040) is an introductory electromagnetism course, specifically designed for non-physics concentrators, especially premedical students and those with limited to no prior experience with physics. For this reason, no prerequisites are listed for the course, but some students reported that high school physics and some amount of algebra and/or physics helped them with the course, though it is important to note that the course does not utilize calculus to teach the material.

Professor Jonathan Pober utilized a flipped classroom model, in which lecture material was released before class, and class time itself was utilized for problem solving. This approach received mixed reviews, with some students praising its usefulness in providing repetition that helped them to learn, while others said that it could be intimidating if you did not understand the pre-lecture material before class began. Professor Pober himself was cited as “passionate” and “very receptive to student feedback”. Additionally, one student said that he went so far as to change exam formats based on student needs.

The course had pre-lecture material that was expected to have been watched before class time so that class time could be reserved for going over example problems. Additionally, there were homeworks for each chapter that ended up being roughly weekly or occasionally every other week. For exams, there were three take-home exams, of which two were multiple choice and conceptual and one was written out and more math-based. There were also three in person exams, of which two were written out and more math-based, and one was multiple choice and conceptual. Finally, there were four labs for the lab component of the course, all of which were S/NC, but doing well on them allowed for extra credit.

Overall, this course was good for those who needed to take physics but did not want a physics-intensive course. Professor Pober’s responsiveness to student needs fostered an accommodating environment that, in turn, fostered success in the class. A large determinant for how much a prospective student would enjoy this course is the flipped classroom model - if that inhibits your learning, then this may not be the course for you.";40;24;2;1;0;1;0;0;0;4pm;Afternoon

For first-year students and sophomores who have studied physics previously and have completed a year of calculus. Lectures, conferences, and laboratory. Six hours of attendance. Prerequisites: high school physics and calculus or written permission. S/NC;"Led by Professor Ulrich Heintz, ""Analytical Mechanics"" (PHYS0070) provides a rigorous, calculus-based introduction to Newtonian mechanics. The course is intended for first-years and sophomores who have studied physics previously and have completed a year of calculus. The course is mandatory S/NC and the official prerequisites are high school physics and calculus. Respondents noted that ""Single Variable Calculus, Part II"" (MATH0100), ""Multivariable Calculus Physics/Engineering"" (MATH0200), AP Physics C, and AP Calculus BC were extremely helpful in understanding course material.

Students found Professor Heintz to be enthusiastic, willing to answer questions, and accessible in office hours and over Zoom. Some respondents particularly enjoyed the TopHat questions that let people test their comprehension in class. Class members noted that the instructor taught largely off of his notes and examples from PowerPoint slides, and employed real-life models of different concepts to help students better visualize the information. While some students found this engaging, others remarked that he frequently skipped calculations if he considered them too simple, and suggested that his explanations would benefit from more structure. However, he was noted to be ""very friendly and happy to help"" if students needed extra support or clarification.

Assignments for the course consisted of four labs, three exams, and weekly homework, which were quite challenging and generally described as being tougher than the exams. The exams' weight increased over time and labs were graded fairly easily and generally agreed to be helpful in understanding the material. One student remarked that while mastery of the material is difficult, passing the course is easy, as the grade boundaries for an S are lenient.

This course is a good option for students interested in physics or those completing physics prerequisites for other STEM concentrations, as it is mandatory S/NC. However, shoppers without prior physics experience should first check out ""Basic Physics A"" (PHYS0030) or ""Foundations of Mechanics"" (PHYS0050). Prospective students are advised to read the textbook after lecture, especially to facilitate conceptual understanding, and to attend office hours to seek clarification. Shoppers may also want to do homework assignments and scaffold problems with other students in the class, and should be prepared to do a significant amount of work on their own.";70;24;4;1;0;1;0;1;0;1pm;Afternoon

The course includes conferences and evening laboratory sessions.;"“Astronomy and Astrophysics” (PHYS0270) is a course taught by Professor Ian Dell’Antonio that introduces students to the fields of astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology in a more rigorous environment than ""Astronomy” (PHYS0220). Despite its rigor, respondents said that the only background knowledge needed to be successful in PHYS0270 are basic high-school level understanding of geometry, algebra, physics, and “a love for stars, galaxies, and planets.”

Professor Dell’Antonio received overall positive feedback from reviewers. He was enthusiastic, engaging, receptive, and “a great lecturer.” He typically included interesting demonstrations in his lectures and was willing to answer questions students had about the material. There were some mixed feelings about the organization of the lectures, as some respondents felt that the slideshows were hard to follow when reviewing them outside of class. In class, however, students appreciated his willingness to elaborate on topics covered in the presentations and the blackboard.

Almost all students agreed that PHYS0270 exposed them to a surface-level understanding of a wide range of complex subjects within astronomy and astrophysics. They loved the nine labs assigned throughout the semester—one reviewer even wrote, “If you should do the course for anything, do it for the labs.” Only four of the labs were required. In addition to completing the labs, weekly problem sets were assigned. The problem sets were relatively math-heavy, and some respondents suggested future students complete them on time. On top of problem sets and labs, class members also had to read one textbook chapter per week and complete two take-home exams.

In general, respondents felt that PHYS0270 was a fun and intriguing course with a passionate professor who was accommodating to any of his students’ needs. Reviewers want future students to know that Professor Dell’Antonio is always available to clarify their understanding of the coursework and discuss homework problems. If future students manage their time well, this course will be both enjoyable and valuable.";270;24;5;1;0;1;0;1;0;1pm;Afternoon

Mill.;"“Introduction to Political Thought” (POLS0110), taught by Professor Alexander Gourevitch, is a writing-designated course exploring the themes of morality, equality, freedom, and authority in politics. Students read the works of some of history’s greatest political thinkers, from Hobbes to Plato to Rousseau. As an introductory political science course, POLS0110 has no required prerequisites, but reviewers found past philosophy, political science, and history courses to be useful background.

Students described Professor Gourevitch as a passionate lecturer who “knows what he’s talking about.” Some found his lectures to be quite fast-paced but added that lectures were very effective at illuminating difficult material from the readings. Responders also mentioned that Professor Gourevitch was always willing to stay after class to talk to students and answer questions. POLS0110 also includes weekly discussion sections led by TAs. The TAs had weekly office hours and did all of the grading for this course.

Assignments for POLS0110 included three papers, weekly readings, and a take-home final exam. Each consecutive paper was longer and counted for a higher percentage of the final grade. Students said the weekly readings were very long and ranged from “relatively understandable” to “difficult to comprehend.” Reviewers found the papers to be reasonably challenging but said the final exam was rather difficult. The exam included a quote-identification portion, which students felt unprepared for. Besides the exam, students felt most of the coursework was quite relevant.

Overall, students felt they highly benefited from Professor Gourevitch’s engaging lectures. They did feel, however, that readings could have been shorter or fewer in number. Respondents also wished that the take-home final exam had been simpler. Reviewers highly suggested that future students of POLS0110 do their best to always keep up with the readings. Students were split on whether or not they would recommend POLS0110 to non-concentrators, but they nearly all felt that they learned a lot.";110;27;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;3pm;Afternoon

Political Science;POLS 2040;Institutions, Crime, and Violence;Will examine relationships and interactions among institutions, criminal actors, and violence. State-based institutions play an important role in explaining the level of disorganized or organized crime. Organized crime groups, in turn, influence both state-based institutions (for example, through corrupting officials) and other criminal activity, often by creating the “rules of the game” by which other criminals can act. Finally, both state-based and criminal actors and institutions influence the level of violence in society. Each of these three influences, and is influenced by, the others. This course offers the opportunity to better understand how these three factors relate to each other.;;2040;27;20;3;3;3;3;3;3;3;3

Political Science;POLS 2341;Supposing Hannah Arendt is Antiblack, Then What?;What would it mean to reckon with the anti-blackness found in the corpus of Hannah Arendt, arguably one of the greatest political theorists of the twentieth century? The course approaches this question in two parts. The first half of the course will be devoted to critically engaging, on their own terms, the texts within Arendt’s corpus that theorize blackness through considerations of education, slavery, settler-colonialism, education, civil disobedience and revolutionary violence. The second half of the course will turn to a growing secondary literature that has reckoned with Arendt’s anti-blackness and offers alternative conceptions of the political, the social and common sense to propose new ground for theorizing the possibilities of black flourishing. After doing the careful work of critical reconstruction throughout the semester, students will be positioned to offer their own research-informed insights about the question of the course.;;2341;27;24;3;0;0;1;0;0;4pm;Afternoon

Except for students who have advanced Persian skills through outside contact with the language, the prerequisite for this course is completion of ""Intermediate Persian Language and Culture"" (PRSN0400).

Reviewers wrote that Professor Iraj Anvar’s feedback in class was extremely helpful, adding that he always gave friendly advice and was open to new material. They felt that he made plenty of time for his students outside of class. This course only met once a week, and one thing students would have liked to see was more conversation time in class or in separate conversation sections. Regardless, respondents thought that Professor Anvar led engaging and helpful classes.

Graded work for PRSN0500 include a midterm and a final exam, as well as weekly readings and written assignments. These assignments were often translations of short stories, either from Persian to English or vice versa. Students enjoyed the stories they read for this course, as well as the translation assignments themselves. They wrote that while translations were challenging, they were excellent learning tools. On average, reviewers spent three hours working on each week’s assignments.

Students in “Advanced Persian Language and Culture I” appreciated the literature they were introduced to in the course.

What experiences, emotions, and constraints characterized women’s religious lives? What was public and what was private? What were the family issues involved? How were religions gendered? Were there major differences between religions that included goddesses and priestesses, and those that did not? Were notions of gender fixed or fluid? Could they enable religious freedoms for women? We will explore these and other questions through a consideration of religions Greek, Roman, Jewish, and Christian between roughly 500 BCE and 500 CE, with a focus on the Roman Empire. Discussion;"*Please note that this course was taught online – this review may not be reflective of future semesters*

""Women and Gender in Ancient Religions"" (RELS0090A) is a first year seminar course that discusses the lives of women in ancient religious contexts. The course focuses on Ancient Greek, Roman, Jewish, and Christian cultures and religions.

Religious Studies;RELS 0140;Food, Religion and Politics in South Asia;Why study food? What can food tell us about religion, politics, and culture? Food in South Asia often shapes identity, social status, ritual purity, religious belonging, and political activism—the notion that you are what you eat has wide currency. Whatever form it takes, food embodies histories of migration, trade, empire, colonialism, and ethics. Through reading primary texts and ethnographic articles, watching films, and (of course) eating delicious food, we will explore the rich foodways of South Asia and their social, religious, and political ramifications.;;140;26;11;2;3;3;3;3;3;3;3
Religious Studies;RELS 0145;Karma, Rebirth and Liberation: Life and Death in South Asian Religions;"Karma, Sanskrit for the ""action"" that makes up a human life, has been a central concern for the religious traditions of South Asia throughout their history. Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism share the belief that after death people are reborn, taking on lives according to their actions in lives previous. In these traditions, liberation from the cycle of rebirth becomes the ultimate goal of human existence. This course examines the ideas of karma, rebirth and liberation in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism from historical, cosmological, ritual, narrative, iconographic and theological points of view. We also look at these ideas in Western culture.";"Interested in studying rebirth and karma, which are present in many South Asian religious traditions? Then you should consider taking “Karma, Liberation + Rebirth” (RELS0145) with Professor Finnian Moore-Gerety! This seminar studies karma in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism from a variety of perspectives, including through historical, theological, and ritual lenses. There are no official prerequisites for this course, and students reported that none are necessary except for an open and inquiring mind.

Professor Moore-Gerety split the class into lectures and discussions, both of which students enjoyed. Survey respondents praised his energy and passion for the subject, stating that it came across in his engaging lectures. In addition, reviewers liked how Professor Moore-Gerety encouraged people to discuss their own ideas and generate their own answers to questions, rather than doing all the talking himself. However, some respondents commented that the discussions could be lackluster if students hadn’t done the readings in advance. Students reported that Professor Moore-Gerety provided timely, specific, and helpful feedback on papers, while meetings with him outside of class were friendly and useful.

Class assignments consisted of weekly readings and two-page reflection papers, in addition to midterm and final papers. Students reported that the weekly assignments “required a good amount of thinking” and forced them to form opinions about the topics studied. While the readings and papers took a certain amount of time and thought, survey respondents found them very relevant to the course and useful for stimulating class discussion, even though they were difficult for some students.

Overall, students enjoyed this class, praising the thought-provoking readings and class discussions and engaging lectures. Respondents suggested that the class meet more than once a week in the future and also advised students to stay on top of the work, as it was easy to fall behind. If you are interested in the topic and have enough time in your schedule, consider shopping “Karma, Liberation + Rebirth” if you’re looking for “a fun, informative and perspective broadening course” that one student reported “has helped shape my view on a broad array of subjects in my day to day life.”";145;26;12;2;0;1;0;0;0;4pm;Afternoon

This course aims to provide students with a foundation for understanding these practices through an exploration of their roots in Chinese medicine, philosophy and religion, as well as their more recent history in modern China and the rest of the world. In addition to studying historical and scholarly interpretations of these practices, students will also have the opportunity to learn basic Qigong and Taijiquan in weekly labs.;;520;26;13;2;3;3;3;3;3;3;3
Religious Studies;RELS 0560;Contemplation and Social Action;The spiritual path is often called an inward journey. Practices like contemplation, renunciation, meditation and seclusion are often experienced in isolation with the mind drawn towards the self. This may seem counterproductive to social action, almost selfish, but exemplary spiritual aspirants from across time and space have demonstrated how contemplation can be a powerful medium of social change. By exploring key historical movements (Indian Independence, Abolitionism, Civil Rights) and transformational figures who have embodied the ideals of engaged contemplation (Gautama Buddha, Mohandas K. Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr., Thich Nhat Hanh and the Dalai Lama), this course seeks to elucidate relevant ways in which contemplative philosophies and practices can challenge, critique, and ultimately transform the world in which we live by way of peaceful, inclusive and socially engaged means.;N/A;560;26;14;2;1;0;0;0;0;3pm;Afternoon

Religious Studies;RELS 0750;Law and Religion;"In our arguably “post-secular” age, conflicts over the relationship between religion and law have again moved to the forefront of international debate. In a multicultural and globalized world, such conflicts often provoke contestation over the very possibility of universal definitions of either “religion” or “law,” let alone their proper relationship. Our interdisciplinary inquiries on these questions will include concrete legal disputes in domestic and international courts; theoretical debates over the construction of “religion” in fields such as anthropology, religious studies, and philosophy; and historiographical controversies about the relationship between “secularization” and sovereignty, particularly in light of the legacy of colonialism.";"Have you ever wondered about the limits of free exercise of religion? Are you curious about the oldest values of the highest court in the land? If so, “Law and Religion” (RELS0750) may be the course for you. Taught by Professor Nathaniel Berman, the course’s main goal is to “study classic judicial decisions relating to religion, as well as a series of recent cases that are altering the course of American law.” The bulk of the course is biweekly lectures and discussions, each one focusing on different historical and recent court cases involving freedom of religion. Some past students had minimal prior experience in law and policy that they said was helpful, but none of them reported that any background at all was necessary to succeed in the class.

Professor Berman’s teaching style was almost unanimously acclaimed by students, with many of them describing his lectures as engaging. Also, some students noted his willingness to welcome questions and comments as one of the best parts of the class. Although, one former student felt that sticking closer to the original lesson plans would have helped the course to be more efficient. Another student wrote a glowing review of Professor Berman’s performance, calling him “absolutely brilliant” and “very responsive to students needing help.” One more point of note for students considering the class in the future is that Professor Berman teaches without slides, which may make it more difficult for some students to follow along.

“Law and Religion” requirements include attendance, participation, short weekly discussion posts, one “moot court” argument reenacting a case discussed in class, an 800-word midterm paper, and a 1600-word final paper. Furthermore, readings were assigned before every class, with one former student estimating a load of about 100 pages each week. Although some students recounted spending a lot of time on the readings, every single one described them as interesting and worthwhile.

Largely due to Professor Berman’s enthusiastic and open teaching style and the many fascinating readings that he assigns, RELS0750 is a favorite of many students. Furthermore, multiple former students recommend that anyone take it, regardless of background in law or religious studies.";750;26;16;2;0;1;0;1;0;2:30pm;Afternoon

An important strain of democratic theory holds that citizenship involves a shared pursuit of democratic qualities of thought, feeling, and action. Others think that perfectionism is only suitable for morality, not politics. For Plato and those influenced by him, beauty and desire are central to the process of moral formation. Others emphasize the importance of community as a context for moral improvement, and some point to the special significance of exemplars.

Oral and written communication in Russian; emphasis on the literary and everyday culture of Russia and the former U.S.S.R., including the changes that have reshaped everyday life for citizens of Russia. Five meetings per week, plus use of audio, video, and web materials. Enrollment limited to 18.";"Professor Lynne Debenedette's course, ""Introductory Russian,"" is a language class that introduces students to the Russian language and culture. Since this was an introductory course, there were no official prerequisites, but most students found having studied another foreign language to be useful because they were able to easily transfer study methods and some grammar (depending on the language studied).

Christopher Carr was the instructor who led classes. Because the class was so small, many class members appreciated the individualized attention that they were able to receive from him. They found him easy to approach with questions and patient in answering them. Reviewers also noted that he was very enthusiastic and easily reachable by email.

Coursework included six unit exams, two papers, weekly listening quizzes, weekly graded homework assignments, and daily homework. The textbook was seen as helpful and necessary since students were expected to have studied and formed a basic grasp of the material on their own before attending each lecture. There were mixed reviews about the worksheets that were provided for practice: Some survey respondents found them helpful for reinforcing material, but others found them redundant and repetitive. Even though the number of assignments was very high, reviewers pointed out that it actually wasn't that much work since the assignments themselves weren't very difficult.

Students recommended this course as a solid introduction to Russian for ""everyone who loves Russian literature, history, or culture,"" saying that even though the workload and daily classes may seem intimidating at first, it's extremely rewarding in the end.";100;12;1;1;0;1;0;1;0;2:30pm;Afternoon

Russian;RUSS 1210;Art from the Underground: Currents of Soviet Nonconformist Art;What is Soviet underground art and from where did it arise? Is it a continuation of the avant-garde, a Western knock-off, a kind of political protest or passivist dissent, or something else? This course introduces students not only to the world of Soviet Nonconformist visual art, but also to the historical and political context that shaped the period and the artistic movements therein. The course begins by laying a foundation concerning what preceded the underground movements, from the Russian and Soviet avant-garde to Stalinist Socialist realism, before examining the development of Soviet Nonconformist art from the mid 1950s to current day Russian art activism. By opening up the discourse to the Baltics, Georgia, Ukraine, and Central Asia, this course moves beyond the Russian-centric approach to Soviet Nonconformist art toward a more comprehensive understanding of what was occurring across the Soviet Union.;;1210;12;6;2;0;1;0;0;0;4pm;Afternoon

We will study how different utopian visions of the city in art, literature, film, and architecture affected the radical transformations of its urban landscape from the October Revolution to the present. We will start with the 1920s and 1930s, when the image of a new Moscow became closely associated with the creation of new socialist ways of life, and conclude with the neoliberal facelift of the city in the post-Soviet period, retracing a history of 20th-century Russian culture through its urban imagination.;;1440;12;9;3;0;1;0;1;0;1pm;Afternoon

Sanskrit;SANS 0300;Sanskrit Epic Narrative;"Consolidates and extends the knowledge of Sanskrit grammar introduced in first year Sanskrit; acquaints students first-hand with basic themes of ancient Indian culture, and cultivates the reading and interpretive skills necessary to read epic and closely related Sanskrit narrative with comprehension and increased fluency. Prerequisite: SANS 0200.";"“Intermediate Sanskrit” is the second year progression from “Elementary Sanskrit”. This class is designed to provide students with the opportu-nity to read narrative Sanskrit texts in prose and verse. The class also works on improving grammar and translation skills. The prerequisites for this class are Sanskrit 10 and 20 which together are the “Elementary Sanskrit” courses. Some students also said that having a background in ancient Greek or Latin helped in this class.

Respondents felt that Professor Scharf’s style in a small class setting was perfect for this class. He was extremely motivating and encouraged class participation regularly. He was also very accommodating to individual interests and learning styles. Respondents always felt at ease in the class and were not afraid to ask questions. Overall, students were pleased with his teaching methods and felt he was very helpful throughout the class.

The class is centered on many of the Sanskrit readings. Most students found the other readings, especially the book about the history of classical Indian literature, very interesting. The graded assignments included about 10 to 20 verses of translations done per class, a midterm, and a final examination. Many students suggested that the material on the two exams could be equalized. They felt that the midterm had far more material then the final.

Most students commented that the number of hours per week varied on how difficult the translation for the week was. On average students would spend about seven hours each week on the class but the amount of time put in increased for difficult translations and when exams approached. All the students highly recommended this class but warned that you need to put in a lot of effort to get anything out of the class.";300;2;1;2;0;1;0;1;0;10:30am;Morning

South Asian Studies;SAST 0140;Food, Religion and Politics in South Asia;Why study food? What can food tell us about religion, politics, and culture? Food in South Asia often shapes identity, social status, ritual purity, religious belonging, and political activism—the notion that you are what you eat has wide currency. Whatever form it takes, food embodies histories of migration, trade, empire, colonialism, and ethics. Through reading primary texts and ethnographic articles, watching films, and (of course) eating delicious food, we will explore the rich foodways of South Asia and their social, religious, and political ramifications.;;140;3;1;1;3;3;3;3;3;3;3
South Asian Studies;SAST 0145;Karma, Rebirth and Liberation: Life and Death in South Asian Religions;"Karma, Sanskrit for the ""action"" that makes up a human life, has been a central concern for the religious traditions of South Asia throughout their history. Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism share the belief that after death people are reborn, taking on lives according to their actions in lives previous. In these traditions, liberation from the cycle of rebirth becomes the ultimate goal of human existence. This course examines the ideas of karma, rebirth and liberation in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism from historical, cosmological, ritual, narrative, iconographic and theological points of view. We also look at these ideas in Western culture.";"Interested in studying rebirth and karma, which are present in many South Asian religious traditions? Then you should consider taking “Karma, Liberation + Rebirth” (RELS0145) with Professor Finnian Moore-Gerety! This seminar studies karma in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism from a variety of perspectives, including through historical, theological, and ritual lenses. There are no official prerequisites for this course, and students reported that none are necessary except for an open and inquiring mind.

Professor Moore-Gerety split the class into lectures and discussions, both of which students enjoyed. Survey respondents praised his energy and passion for the subject, stating that it came across in his engaging lectures. In addition, reviewers liked how Professor Moore-Gerety encouraged people to discuss their own ideas and generate their own answers to questions, rather than doing all the talking himself. However, some respondents commented that the discussions could be lackluster if students hadn’t done the readings in advance. Students reported that Professor Moore-Gerety provided timely, specific, and helpful feedback on papers, while meetings with him outside of class were friendly and useful.

Class assignments consisted of weekly readings and two-page reflection papers, in addition to midterm and final papers. Students reported that the weekly assignments “required a good amount of thinking” and forced them to form opinions about the topics studied. While the readings and papers took a certain amount of time and thought, survey respondents found them very relevant to the course and useful for stimulating class discussion, even though they were difficult for some students.

Overall, students enjoyed this class, praising the thought-provoking readings and class discussions and engaging lectures. Respondents suggested that the class meet more than once a week in the future and also advised students to stay on top of the work, as it was easy to fall behind. If you are interested in the topic and have enough time in your schedule, consider shopping “Karma, Liberation + Rebirth” if you’re looking for “a fun, informative and perspective broadening course” that one student reported “has helped shape my view on a broad array of subjects in my day to day life.”";145;3;2;2;0;1;0;0;0;4pm;Afternoon
South Asian Studies;SAST 0750;Understanding the Indian Economy;With a view to help understanding the Indian economy, the course will discuss a number of topics. The aim will be to become conversant with a number of contemporary issues such as demonetisation, Goods and Services Tax (GST), the GDP numbers controversy, fiscal federalism and the outlook for the Indian economy post-COVID. But understanding the economy today will also require becoming familiar with the past and how ideas, events, and developments of the past shaped the India of today in terms of the basic Indian development model, structural transformation, India’s economic and financial crises, the state of state capacity, and gender and other outcomes.;N/A;750;3;3;3;1;0;0;0;0;3pm;Afternoon

Authentic materials from diverse sources will provide an overview of the American Deaf community. Basic media literacy skills will be taught.
This is the first half of a year-long course whose first semester grade is normally a temporary one. Neither semester may be elected independently without special written permission. The final grade at the end of the course work in SIGN 0200 covers the entire year and is recorded as the final grade for both semesters.";"*Please note that this course was taught online – this review may not be reflective of future semesters*

Have you ever taken a course where there’s no speaking in class at all? “American Sign Language” (SIGN0100) is such a year-long total immersion course that is taught completely in sign language. It introduces not only communicative skills in American Sign Language (ASL) but also Deaf culture and the American Deaf community. Students reported that no prerequisite is necessary for this introductory course, but some did note that background knowledge in sign language or previous experience of taking language courses at Brown could be beneficial.

Professor Heather Nowicki was very receptive to student's needs and very accommodating. She used PowerPoints to guide the class discussion and explain concepts that students would otherwise not have understood if they were signed. During the class, breakout groups were frequently used, which was reported to be a great way to practice signing. One student mentioned that, while complete immersion in ASL could be nerve-wracking at the beginning, it forced students to actively engage with the language, which helped them pick up things very quickly. Reviewers also praised Professor Nowicki for her very individualized teaching style and an effective adjustment to Zoom during the pandemic.

The coursework included five textbook reading and writing assignments, daily workbook reading, online modules, 6 in-class unit exams, 2 video recordings of ASL story, and 5 additional short videos, to which Professor Nowicki gave great feedback. Students were also required to attend 5 Brown ASL events and provide a written summary. One respondent noted that the assignments were important for them to apply what they had learned in class, which helped to ensure that they have a good grasp of the material.

Overall, students enjoyed this “pretty chill” class. The lessons were fast-paced, but at the end of the semester, students showed significant improvement in the language and also gained valuable knowledge in Deaf culture and the Deaf community.";100;3;1;1;1;0;1;0;1;2pm;Afternoon

A background in ASL is necessary as prerequisites include ASL 100, ASL 200, ASL 300, and ASL 400.

Students praised Professor Riker as a highly effective instructor who was responsive and accessible with his teachings. He was very patient and understanding with his lessons and willing to explain concepts again if necessary. Professor Riker's class format involved participation from all students, but most students felt comfortable with the environment because of Professor Riker's calm, open demeanor and ability to fully listen to and answer questions. According to many reviewers, he greatly strengthened their ASL skills and helped them become comfortable signing in different settings. Students said that Professor Riker was consistently available to provide feedback and constructively discuss a students' strengths, as well as possible areas for improvement. Reviewers also stressed that he was never negative about students' abilities and willing to help whoever needed further instruction.

Students found the regular class readings, which consisted of formal health presentations, informal discussions, and storytelling, helpful and insightful. A few students desired even more in-depth readings to help with their knowledge of deaf culture and ASL as a whole. Coursework was comprised of regular readings and five in-class presentations.

Students spent about one to three hours per week completing coursework. This course was universally recommended for all students, regardless of their background in ASL. Most students simply wrote, ""TAKE IT.""";500;3;3;3;1;0;1;0;1;2pm;Afternoon

Sociology;SOC 0010;Social Forces: An Introduction to Sociology;Social forces constrain and empower us, bond us together and push us apart. Sociology explores the workings of societies large and small: nations, organizations, communities, families, and other groups. How do societies shape action and identity, and why are social pressures so hard to defy? How do societies distribute wealth and power, and why do inequalities so often coalesce around race, ethnicity, class, and gender? How do established practices persist, and when do movements arise to challenge them? Examining such themes across a range of issues and topics, this course provides a springboard for future study throughout the social sciences.;"How does society affect identity? And how do identities affect society? “Social Forces: An Introduction to Sociology” (SOC0010) explores these questions along with other concepts central to sociology. As this is an introductory course, there are no official prerequisites for this course. Many students simply noted that an interest in the subject was enough to succeed in this course.

SOC0010 was taught by Professor Daniel Hirschman. Many respondents emphasized that Professor Hirschman’s lectures were notably clear and easily accessible; a few students commented that his frequent connections between the broad subjects covered made the topics discussed seem more cohesive and interesting. Even more, he and the TAs of the course was noted to be very receptive to meeting students during office hours.

Coursework for SOC0010 consisted of weekly readings and canvas posts. Official assignments also consisted of three short papers. Respondents noted that these assignments, though useful, seemed to be limited by the broadness of the material; in other words, they seemed interesting only so far as the student was willing to engage with them.

Overall, respondents found this course a good introduction to sociology. However, due to the online nature of the course, and the leniency encouraged by such a format, many students noted that this course didn’t feel as engaging as it could have been. Students seemed to agree that potential shoppers should let their potential experience with the course’s online format rather than their potential inexperience in sociology affect whether or they take this class. For motivated and interested students, however, it provided a “unique perspective for understanding the current affairs happening in the world.”";10;33;1;1;0;1;0;1;0;9am;Morning
Sociology;SOC 0030;Race, Immigration, and the Making of Inequality;In what ways has the interpretation of race and immigration shaped the current system of stratification in American society? This course focuses on answering this question from a historical and contemporary perspective.  Using a sociological approach, we analyze the meaning of ethno-racial formation and categorization and survey the different processes that contribute to ethno-racial inequality. Engaging empirical research, we pay special attention to how individuals and groups interpret and experience the institutional arrangements that perpetuate exclusion and disadvantage by race and immigration status. The course aims to provide the analytical tools required to understand race relations in everyday life.;N/A;30;33;2;1;1;0;0;0;0;3pm;Afternoon
Sociology;SOC 0230;Sex, Gender, and Society;An introduction to the sociological study of sex and gender. More specifically, this course explores how sexuality is perceived, defined, and experienced in the context of society. How sexuality influences our lives, is reflected in social norms, attitudes and beliefs, through public and private policies and practices, and the social institutions is also investigated. This class also focuses on how prevalent gender differences really are in our society and examines the social construction of gender.;;230;33;3;1;3;3;3;3;3;3;3
Sociology;SOC 0300;Organizations and Society;We live in a society of organizations. We are born inside organizations, we are educated inside organizations, we work inside organizations, and when we die, we will be buried by organizations. Organizations are therefore central to processes that shape individual lives and societal trends, from widening income inequality, to the spread of innovations, to struggles over public policy. This course introduces the field of Organizational Studies, examining organizations as complex, multifaceted social settings. By investigating how organizations and society shape each other, students will build skills for informed, socially-responsible engagement in an increasingly organizational society.;"""Organizations and Society"" (SOC0300) explores the centrality of organizations in every sector of daily life, examining their effects on individual lives to larger societal tendencies, such as increasing income inequality, dispersal of innovations, and disputes over public policy. The course has no official prerequisites and students indicated that no background knowledge was needed.

Instruction consisted of lectures and discussion, both in small groups and as a class, though the majority of time was dedicated to lecture. Professor Rachel Wetts' teaching style was described to be extremely effective, as she was praised for her thorough explanation of concepts. Respondents further noted that Professor Wetts was open to other people's perspectives and always made sure to address students' questions.

Sociology;SOC 0310;Theory and Practice of Engaged Scholarship;Efforts are underway across college and university campuses—in the United States and globally—to increase opportunities for community-engaged teaching, learning, and research. What is engaged scholarship and how does it challenge (and/or complement) more traditional concepts of scholarship and disciplinary knowledge? What are the historical, practical, methodological, ethical, and other considerations associated with engaged scholarship? Through investigating these and other questions, students will emerge from this course with a critical understanding of engaged scholarship at Brown University and in the broader landscape of U.S. higher education. Students will be equipped to design a course of study that integrates community practice with academic knowledge throughout the remainder of their time at Brown and beyond. SOC 0310 fulfills a requirement for the Engaged Scholarship Certificate.;"Efforts are underway across university and college campuses -- in the United States and globally -- to increase opportunities for engaged learning and research. What is engaged scholarship and how does it challenge (and/or complement) more traditional concepts of scholarship and disciplinary knowledge? What are the ethical, practical, and other challenges associated with community-engaged scholarship? “Theory and Practice of Engaged Scholarship (ESP Seminar)” (SOC0310) uses case studies, fieldwork, team projects, and guest speakers from diverse disciplines and sectors to investigate these and other questions. The enrollment for this class limited only to Engaged Scholars Program participants. Although the course had no further prerequisites, students felt previous experiences in community engagements and coursework in the humanities/social sciences could be helpful.

The class provides the theoretical and empirical tools required to understand immigration's main theories and empirical debates. The course examines why people migrate and how and why immigrants settle where they do. Additionally, the class examines the structural forces influencing the experiences of immigrant groups in American society and the consequences of international migration for both immigrants and native-born citizens in the United States. Through readings, research, and discussions, students acquire skills needed to objectively analyze how immigration patterns people's lives and simultaneously shapes the boundaries of inclusion and exclusion in society.;N/A;315;33;7;1;0;1;0;1;0;10:30am;Morning
Sociology;SOC 1010;Classical Sociological Theory;"How is modern society organized? What holds society together and what drives social change? Why is there such a large gap between the ""modern"" ideal of formal equality and the reality of factual inequality? Why do differences of class, race and gender persist? What is power and who has it? These questions have motivated generations of sociologists, but many of the arguments continue to be informed by the foundational classical theorists: Karl Marx, Max Weber, Emile Durkheim and W.E.B Du Bois. Looking at the transformations around them – the rise of capitalism, the modern nation-state, rational bureaucracy, the spread of colonialism, the decline of religion, struggles for emancipation and much more – they developed arguments that allow us to better understand ourselves, our actions, and the contemporary political, economic and social transformations around us. We explore the defining contributions of these theorists and link them to current debates and theories on systemic racism, gender/sex struggles, global inequalities, social movements and democracy.";;1010;33;8;1;0;1;0;1;0;10:30am;Morning

Sociology;SOC 1311;Micro-Organizational Theory: Social Behavior in Organizations;"Micro-Organizational Theory focuses on the human dynamics of organizations as natural systems. It examines how individual attitudes, actions, and interactions make a difference for organizational processes and outcomes. This focus is contrasted with more macro-level approaches, which take the organization (instead of the individual) as the primary unit of analysis. For example, studies of organizations from an economic perspective are typically concerned with the performance of the organization relative to its competitors. Studies of organizations from a macro-sociological focus are typically concerned with an organization's routines and structures, contextualized by the broader environment. SOC 1311 takes a more micro and meso perspective that asks questions such as, ""why do individuals in organization behave the way they do, how does this affect the organizations of which they are a part and how, in turn, are individuals affected by their organizations?""";;1311;33;13;2;1;0;1;0;1;11am;Morning

Sociology;SOC 1872E;Global Sociology: Capitalism, Colonialism and the Making of the Modern World;This course seeks to question our sense of place in the world. Sociology often takes the nation as a bounded unit of analysis. Yet, the history of the modern world is one of empires, colonialism and transnational connections. These global racial and colonial histories are frequently ignored or silenced. This course focuses on Providence and Rhode Island to look at the embeddedness of local lives in global social processes. If we acknowledge that the world has always been global, how does that change our understanding of contemporary issues? How should we rethink sociology to break with its colonial origins?;;1872;33;16;2;0;1;0;1;0;4pm;Afternoon
Sociology;SOC 1872G;First-Generation College Students: A Sociological Perspective: A Sophomore Seminar;Colleges have expanded their focus on diversity to include the social class origins of prospective students. One consequence is the emergence of the notion of first-generation college students: those who are the first in their families to attend college. We examine the challenges facing first-gens as they pursue higher education, focusing on two sources of difficulty: gaining admission and acclimating oneself to college, both academically and socially.Our goals are two-fold: (1) To understand the social barriers, compromises, and internal conflicts that first-generation college students face, and, (2) consider how institutional and structural forces impact and shape these students.;;1872;33;17;2;0;0;1;0;0;3pm;Afternoon
Sociology;SOC 1872O;Critical Race Theory;We will examine US race, racism, and racial inequality through the lens of critical race theory. We start with an examination of the development of critical race theory in the legal academy and explore the foundational principles of the theoretical framework. We will utilize a critical race frame to analyze the law as a tool of the US racial state, a mechanism through which the state has created and maintained race privilege and corresponding racial oppression. We will also compare the critical race paradigm that developed in the legal academy to some of the most critical race perspectives in sociology.;;1872;33;18;2;0;1;0;1;0;1pm;Afternoon
Sociology;SOC 1873D;Inequality of Infant Health;Infant health has become increasingly unequal since 2010. Medical improvements and greater access to health insurance predict greater equality, but underweight and preterm births have become increasingly likely for unmarried and Black mothers with low levels of education. Why? What contributes to infant health and how could policies improve outcomes for marginalized mothers? This course examines contexts and resources that shape infant health and how infant health shapes life chances for children.

Sociology;SOC 2260I;Cultural Politics and Critical Social Theory;In this graduate seminar we explore intellectual interventions analyzing how power relations work with an eye toward their transformation even while aware of reaction's proximity. More than an analysis of ideas, this knowledge cultural sociology addresses how cultural politics articulate both rational critical discourse and affect-laden transformational praxis and solidarities. Student interests shape our foci, but sociologists engaging critical race theory, decolonizing knowledge, queer scholarship and reproductive rights will be there alongside sociologists like Patricia Hill Collins, Craig Calhoun, Nancy Fraser, Raewynn Connell, Rhacel Salazar Parreñas, and Zeynep Tufekci, each exemplifying alternative 21st century knowledge activisms.;;2260;33;27;3;0;1;0;0;0;9am;Morning
Sociology;SOC 2330;States, Power, Politics;How do people collectively negotiate rights within contexts of severe social, economic, and political inequality? What forms do these negotiations take and why? What are the consequences of various forms of political engagement? In this seminar, we answer these questions by debating key theories of collective action and reading a series of recent monographs in political sociology. The class highlights political processes in Asia, Latin America, and Africa and focuses on negotiations between states and civilians. At the end of the class, students will better understand how social categories, such as class and gender, interact with key institutional features of developing and post-colonial states to shape the dynamics of contention.;;2330;33;28;3;1;0;0;0;0;9am;Morning

Professor Connie Crawford was praised by respondents as an understanding instructor who was accommodating to students’ needs. Reviewers liked the incredible passion she brought to class, and how she was able to conduct a class that flowed naturally and did not feel forced.

Assignments for the course consisted mostly of group scenes that students would work on with their partners, along with short responses after each performance. There were also some readings, especially at the start of the semester, that were largely considered to be relatively easy. The course also includes a mandatory tech component, which involves students serving as the backstage and technical crew for one of the TAPS departments’ productions for the semester.

Overall, reviewers recommended the course. In particular, they noted that prospective students would get out of it what they put into it.";30;40;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;9am;Morning

The class, with no prerequisite classes, is designed as an introductory course for those with little or no experience in the area—though students mentioned that backgrounds in the literary arts and writing, particularly writing for theater plays was helpful.

Professor Terry-Morgan was described as very supportive of students’ creativity and willingness to try new things. Many appreciated how he was very accommodating, as he allowed students to take the lead in workshops and presentations, which was found to be helpful in improving their playwriting abilities. Students also praised Professor Terry-Morgan’s enthusiasm for the art of playwriting in general, as well as his efforts to connect with every student individually, create a positive and uplifting classroom environment, and ensure they were properly accommodated.

Classwork for TAPS0100 consisted of two to three readings for the semester, as well as one three-to-five page scene weekly and a twenty-page play for the final exam. Discussions of reading and workshops were mainly student-led, and generally described as fun. The workshops were devoted to the discussion of student written plays; as such, many respondents underscored the importance of devoting apt time to writing the plays before such workshops.

Overall, the class was described as a course that can be challenging but is always rewarding. Even more, TAPS0100 was regarded as a perfect introduction for students both outside and inside of the concentration.

""Playwriting I"" (TAPS0100) is a prerequisite for this course. However, students noted that a background in theatre was also helpful in preparing for TAPS0200.

Students praised Professor Searle for having a ""passionate"" and ""incredibly engaging"" teaching style. Respondents enjoyed her relaxed class structure, which provided a forum for discussions and the development of ideas. However, some students wished that Professor Searle had provided more structure, as discussions sometimes could be unfocused and poorly time-managed. Most students agreed that Professor Searle was usually available outside of class but failed to respond to emails in a timely manner.

The assignments for TAPS0200 consisted of facilitating class discussion, weekly readings, writing weekly short plays, and continuously working on a longer final play throughout the semester. Students felt that the assignments were usually relevant to class material but would have liked more structure. In addition, students felt that facilitated discussion was often not as relevant. Students reported spending on average about three hours per week on the course and about five on a busy week.

In general, students enjoyed the small class size and the in-class discussions. Students noted that Professor Searle often diverged from deadlines on the syllabus; respondents stated that they would have appreciated more structure in course content and more notice before assignments were due. In addition, students recommended that in the future Professor Searle should add peer workshopping to the class in order to learn more from fellow peers. The course was mixed with both concentrators and non-concentrators as well as those who were taking the class as a requirement.
